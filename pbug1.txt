Configure fails looking for libXpm on Red Hat 6.1 - ID: 203865
Last Update: Comment added ( watts )
Details:

'configure' fails on Red Hat Linux 6.1 with all errata applied. I don't
know enough about autoconf to figure out why it can't find this library. A
simple patch that corrects this problem is:

--- configure.orig Fri Jan 22 15:24:00 1999
+++ configure Thu Dec 30 04:41:34 1999
@@ -7,6 +7,10 @@
# This configure script is free software; the Free Software Foundation
# gives unlimited permission to copy, distribute and modify it.

+# Added by Jeffrey Watts &lt;watts@jayhawks.net&gt; to get TT to build
under
+# Red Hat GNU/Linux 6.1 (glibc2.1)
+LDFLAGS=-L/usr/X11R6/lib

# Defaults:

ac_default_prefix=/usr/local

Here's the error message that 'configure' spit out:

checking for XpmCreatePixmapFromData in -lXpm... no

*** Could not find XPM library (libXpm).
*** Make sure that it is installed and set
*** the LDFLAGS environment variable to point to it
*** with -L(path) before re-running configure.

Bob, your fix does not solve the problem on RH 6.2. I get the same error
message. I\'m using the current CVS (with your fixes included).

Few things:
1) repository now has correct fix
2) a patch modifying configure is useless because the next autoconf will
just overwrite it anyway
3) \'tail -25 config.log\' will usually explain the problem
4) Adding ${X_LIBS} ${X_PRE_LIBS} ${X_EXTRA_LIBS} -lX11 as additional
libraries to the AC_CHECK_LIB() for -lXpm fixes the problem.
