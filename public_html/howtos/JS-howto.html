	<P>The JS/AS combination is one of the most efficient
	neuting/taking forces available to a Paradise Netrek team.
	Striking quickly and often without much opposition, an AS
	docked onto a JS can quickly gain another planet for the
	team or perform a neut with almost 100 percent chance of
	success so that someone else can backtake. A clued JS/AS
	team is certainly an annoyance to the opposing team and in
	addition to your neuting/taking you can also help your
	cause by getting enemy players to waste time that could
	otherwise be used doing useful things futilely chasing you
	across the galaxy. </p>

	<P>The point I stress however, is that the JS/AS
	combination is a <B><I>team</B></I>. You and your JS must
	work together to make the most use of the JS's speed. Like
	any process the rate of progress is dictated by the
	slowest factor, in this case the AS as it is essentially a
	slow-moving troop transport. The JS pilot has his own set
	of skills to master and enough problems to worry about
	without having his taker doing things he doesn't expect
	and getting them both of you killed. I've actually had
	takers finding resources on a planet upon orbit and
	spending time bombing off the resources <I>before</I>
	taking it! </p>

	<P><B>Communication</B> is the key -- talk to your JS
	often and let him know if you are damaged, how many armies
	you have and can carry, and any neut/take planet
	recommendations. Once you partner up a few times the two
	of you will start to form an understanding of each other's
	habits and you will know what you can expect from each
	other when the enemy starts contesting your neut/takes.
	For example, if you know your JS is going to run off
	anytime red alert comes up you'll quickly learn not to
	lock onto things or carry 20 armies ;). </p>

	<P>This said, let's get to the list of hints I propose.
	These suggestions are things I have picked up from both
	riding good JSs and JS piloting. Other JS/AS teams may
	have their own ideas on how to do things so nothing here
	is written in stone, but it is certainly one of the valid
	ways to work as a JS/AS team. </p>


<HR>
<OL>
<LI>
<p>
	<b>Always cloak</b>. Otherwise, enemy ships can pull you off the
	JS and then doosh you. In addition, you'll give away your
	JS's position when they see an AS hurtling around at warp
	45 on the galactic. Cloaking while docked costs you
	nothing, and retains your element of surprise. The only
	time you should be uncloaked is when you want your JS to
	pick you up after you pickup/neut/take. This is so your JS
	can tractor you and initiate docking quicker as well as
	letting your JS see that you are docked on properly and
	not just circling all around him. Once docked, cloak.
</p>
<LI>
<p>
	If under ogg, don't uncloak and fight unless
	<B>absolutely</B> sure of success. This is typically a
	case where you are at an acceptably remote planet and the
	ogger cannot expect backup soon. If you are at a planet
	close to enemy core, then it is not advisable since the
	ogger's buddies are likely to show up quickly and any
	delay in getting back on your JS increases the probability
	that you <B>and</B> your JS will get toasted. Use your
	afterburners liberally and get out of the area. Don't
	worry about going towards your JS -- if he's got any kind
	of self-preservation instinct he's already ABed out of
	phasor range and is beginning to look for the
	friendly-colored cloak crosshairs. If you're in a safe
	area, he will come get you.
</p>
<LI>
<P>
	Never lock onto any planet until your JS either puts you
	right over the target planet or he stops to one side of it
	(which he shouldn't be doing). Otherwise if he needs to
	make a speedy getaway, during his warp prep time when he
	is at zero impulse, you will disengage and be left behind.
</p>
<LI>
<P>
	If your JS is afraid to take shield damage, once he puts
	you close to the planet, AB towards it and lock on,
	remaining cloaked. Bomb and neut/take. If he is a nice JS
	and puts you over the planet, he will remain above impulse
	4 the entire approach time so that you will not disengage
	by accident. Once right over the planet, he will drop to
	impulse 3 or less at which time you should lock onto the
	planet. You'll begin orbit right away, and you should
	quickly bomb and neut/take.
</p>
<LI>
<P>
	Once you pickup/neut/take, uncloak and your JS will pick
	you up. Apparently if you go impulse 2 and you are locked
	on to the JS all he has to do is pass over you and
	autodock will be initiated. If under ogg, follow step 2.
</p>
<LI>
<P>
	Since JS phasors and torps are useless, if he's firing
	them he is trying to alert you that an ogger is coming and
	that you should hurry. Typically he'll fire in the
	direction the threat is coming from. If the threat is
	close, AB in a direction perpendicular to the direction
	your JS is firing so that both you and your JS will be out
	of the path of the incoming ogger.
</p>
<LI>
<P>
	Use shift-f liberally to tell your JS how many armies you
	have, or shift-e if you are hurt and need to repair. Also,
	send an occasional message telling what your max army
	capacity is -- something like X/Y to say you have X armies
	and can carry Y. Otherwise, he'll assume you enjoy running
	around putting 1 army at a time on that AGRI. Don't forget
	that you should be using an AS, and that <B>you can refit
	on the JS</B>.
</p>
<LI>
<P>
	The JS is a ship of opportunity. If he suddenly breaks for
	the enemy SY it is likely clear and he wants you to die
	trying to take the SY if you have to. Once taken, you
	should repair the little damage you have and refit to a
	battleship <B>immediately</B>. Don't worry about your
	kills -- your JS can always find another taker. Begin
	defending the SY against the retake. Typically the enemy
	base will return to assist the retake -- expend all
	efforts to crush it. By this time more friendlies should
	be popping at the SY and will help you kill retakers and
	the base.
</p>
<LI>
<P>
	If you have just escaped an ogg attempt and have remained
	docked onto your JS while it ABed out of the line of fire,
	if he appears to be hovering around like he is looking for
	something, he is probably searching for you. Quickly
	uncloak and recloak so that he knows you are still docked
	on and safe. Your JS will then likely go into warp prep
	and speed off. If he remains stationary even after you
	have shown him that you are safe, he's probably ETEMPed
	himself while ABing away -- begin praying that no one
	comes.
</p>
<LI>
<P>
	On a similar note to step 3, watch the galactic at all
	times to see if there are any incoming threats -- your JS
	pilot may be too busy with some other concern to notice
	cloaked oggers coming. If the time constraints won't allow
	you to take the planet safely, simply don't lock onto the
	planet! Stay docked onto the JS and when the JS ABs out of
	the danger zone follow step 9. Your JS will be happy that
	you made his life easier by not forcing him to come back
	to save you.
</p>
<LI>
<P>
	In general, it is <B>not</B> advisable to dock onto your
	JS while cloaked -- this is because he might not notice
	and will continue hovering around looking for you. The
	exception is when you are in a hot zone and someone might
	pull you off your JS the moment you dock. If your JS is
	good he will have uncloaked and is pressor-harrassing the
	oggers. Lock onto him and dock while cloaked. When you
	gauge yourself to be out of any tractor range or your JS
	has ABed out of the path of torps, <B>this</B> is the time
	to follow step 9.
</p>
<LI>
<P>
	Sometimes it is useful to garner the skills of a BB buddy.
	Convince a BB to escort you around by docking onto the JS
	too. When you reach the target planet, your BB will deploy
	and begin smacking anything that dares touch you. If you
	are in trouble, he may even cloak as a decoy 'taker' and
	draw fire away from you. BB buddies rewl. Don't ask for
	one however, if you think you can handle the situation
	alone or your man can be better employed elsewhere. An
	example of an appropriate situation in which to call for
	an escort is when you are finished neuting/taking enemy
	periphery planets and are now trying to sneak core planets
	away. By this time of the game your team is typically
	winning and most of the enemy is patrolling their
	remaining planets. Why bother calling for a clear/escort
	that won't usually come at the proper time (if at all)
	when you can bring <I>fresh, fully fuelled</I> escort BBs
	with you? By the time you are trying to go for the enemy
	core planets, all that most of your team is doing is
	killing off scum bombers, bombing the enemy core, or
	ogging the defending base -- since these people are
	usually doing these jobs in heavy ships, why not give them
	a ride as well as getting some protection for yourself?
</p>
<LI>
<P>
	If you don't have a kill yet want to ride with a trusted
	JS, talk to him and tell him you want to go 'hunting'.
	This involves you refitting into a BB on him and going out
	to find someone to paste, which may or may not include the
	enemy JS. More typically you should try to find an enemy
	player with a good number of kills, especially if they are
	in an AS, since he's likely carrying armies. By killing
	this player you gain more kills than you would by killing
	a 'fresh' ship, and hence you can carry more armies, and
	you save at least one of your planets. Unlike when you are
	neuting/taking planets, you should not cloak. This is so
	your JS can zip past the intended victim and pressor you
	off on top or next to him -- it's much quicker than
	slowing down and letting you off, and the scare is usually
	enough to cause the guy to simply freeze and die quickly.
	Once pressored off, go smash the poor guy -- he'll never
	know what hit him. After the dust has settled, get back
	onto the JS and either go smack someone else or refit to
	an AS for taking.
</p>
<LI>
<P>
	Your JS is <B>extremely</B> fragile. If he has to go into
	or is escaping from an area with torps flying all around,
	DET for the JS since he obviously cannot. If the torp
	density is so high that you die DETting, then likely
	neither of you would have survived anyways. If you don't
	DET and your JS dies, he will probably explode on you and
	take most of your shields and hull with him, and then you
	are dead meat in any case.
</p>

</OL>

<HR>
	<P>These then, are the more important hints I have to
	offer from off the top of my head. One more reminder is
	that if you are forced to defend your hurt or ETEMPed JS,
	get in between him and the threat(s) and DET. Just as in
	defending a base, you are in a better position to DET this
	way and any torps that you fire which your enemy DETs
	cannot cause damage to the guy you are trying to protect.
	This does not apply if the situation is hopeless and you
	are carrying a substantial number of armies -- if the JS
	dies he will just jump into a regular ship and come back
	to help you out. </p>

<P>Happy scumming!
