<h4>What is a UT?</h4>
	Good question. Most people have never seen UT's used
	properly because they are the only ship out there that
	requires real teamwork.(imho) A UT is a BB sized ship,
	which is capable of supporting PT's. When you request a
	PT, if you select utility, you will pop up on your team's
	UT. The UT comes with 12 missiles, each of which can
	become a PT. These PT's are what give the UT it's power. A
	UT is also a mini SB, in that it can carry 12 armies with
	NO kills. I don't mean to boast, but I've saved our team
	with the UT when the SB died. I saw the SB go, OB'd out,
	came in as a UT, and saved as many armies off the SY as I
	could. Then I hid out on a faraway planet and farmed until
	I had 12. Warped in and supplied takers.
	<br> Repeat until SB returns. We won.

<h3>How to be a good PT/UT pair.</h3>

<h3>Instructions for the PT.</h3>

<ol>
<li>
<a name="PTdefendUT"><h4>UT Defense</h4>	
<p>
	Your primary goal is to defend the UT. The UT lets the
	range limited PT appear near the combat zone. You don't
	want the UT to die. When you appear on the UT, take off
	immediately. You are in a crunchy ship, and blowing up on
	the UT will probably kill/cripple it. You have 6 missiles,
	and you should use them all before docking on the UT
	again. When you dock, you will get 6 new missiles, but the
	UT looses one of it's 12 missiles. So try to fire all your
	missiles before you dock, and get the best "missile
	conservation" ratio. </p>

<p>
	[This may no longer be true. Some servers don't make the
	UT pay a missile to reload a PT]

</p>

<li>
<a name="PTadvice"><h4>General Advice</h4>
<p>
	Ideally, one PT should be on call at all times. This
	should be a player who is willing to drop whatever he is
	doing, sundive his ship, and get into a PT when needed. A
	scout bomber is a good person to work off of the UT. He
	can die when needed, and nothing is lost (Whereas a taker
	can't just sundive because the UT needs help.) Watch for
	messages from the UT, and be ready to help. </p>

<li>
<a name="PTogging"><h4>Ogging</h4>
<p>
	Ogging in the PT. Charge in, try to use all the
	missiles, unload your remaining fuel as torps, and then
	buzz around the base like a little bug, wasting the base's
	time, and causing confusion. Don't expect to kill the base
	on your own. You won't. But with a few BB's coming in on
	the base, the combination of attacks should be enough to
	make the kill. Once the base is dead, if there are any
	PT's left on the UT, grab one and use it to protect the UT
	while it escapes the "post ogg massacre."
</p>
</ol>

<li>
<h3>Instructions for the UT.</h3>

<ol>
<li>
<a name="UTjustDo"><h4>Taking the UT out for a spin.</h4>
<p>
	You have the rank. You have the balls. Now you need the
	practice. Before you start flying the UT, it is considered
	polite, and smart, to ask if anybody on your team minds if
	you use the UT. Emphasise that you are new at it, and want
	to get some practice. Usually nobody will mind. The reason
	why you ask is that if you are using the UT, you might be
	preventing the team from using one of the other special
	ships, like the Starbase. This is bad. Probably the best
	time to fly a UT is during the enemy's LPS. Your team has
	a surplus of planets then, and can afford to let you fly
	the UT. You will also be luring twink oggers away from the
	enemy planet, so you might actually help your team. :-)
	</p>

<li>
<a name="UTdogfighting"><h4>Dogfighting in a UT</h4>
<p>
	DON'T. 1 UT missile = 1 PT with 6 missiles. UT torps are
	pathetic. I have never seen them do any real damage to a
	ship. And the phasers are a joke. If you get in trouble,
	yell for your PT's. </p>

<li>
<a name="UTcarry"><h4>Carrying armies, being ogged, HELP ME!"</h4>     
<p>
	If you are carrying armies, by all means, USE THE
	MISSILES. Your goal in this case is to kill the attacker
	and warp out. You can nurse your wounds later, just kill
	that guy and run. UT's have good warp prep times. </p>

<li>
<a name="UTadvice"><h4>General advice</h4>
<p>
	Cloak and move at warp 3. There are very good reasons for
	this. Above warp 4, the PT's cannot undock, and will sit
	on your hull sucking fuel. Cloak, because you don't want
	to get shot at. At warp 3, the UT turns like a scout, and
	can dodge torps suprisingly well. And with the shields
	down, you don't loose fuel. If you get into trouble, use
	the afterburners and then hit your max impulse speed key,
	to keep from overheating. Then start distressing. Your PT
	should see that and come to the rescue. </p>

<p>
	After the fight, be sure to pick up the PT, cuz he'll be
	hurting. Unless you carry. If so, the PT can fuck off.
	You've got your own problems. But in all cases, if you've
	been found, it's time to bug out. Every good netrek player
	has an irresistible urge to ogg UT's mainly because they
	are the easiest 12 army DOOSH out there. And, they're
	usually flown by new players who can't use them properly,
	and so are even more crunchy.
</p>

<li>
<a name="UTlaw"><h4>Green Death's law of UT's</h4>
<p>
	Cowardice and runnerscumming are not only the proper thing
	to do in a UT, <b>IT IS EXPECTED</b>. Don't be a hero
	unless it is LPS.
</p>

<li>
<a name="UTreload"><h4>Reloading missiles</h4>
<p>
	This is pretty elementary stuff here. At 4 missiles, head
	home and refit, or just ob out and come back in as the UT
	again. (How do I ob out?) If you must ask, you shouldn't
	be in the UT yet. But the answer is in the main FAQ.
</p>

<li>
<a name="UTtruck"><h4>The UT towtruck?</h4>
<p>
	Other ships can dock on a UT too. You can help out a
	crippled ship by letting him dock, then sneaking away with
	both of you cloaked. DON'T WARP. You will etemp faster
	than you'd believe. It seems to be related to the weight
	of the docked ships. I tried to move a BB once. I got
	maybe 1 grid square across the galaxy before my engines
	melted.
</p>

<li>
<a name="UTlaunch"><h4>Launching oggers</h4>
<p>
	This is probably the riskiest thing you can do in the
	UT.(Sundiving excluded) You will have to get pretty close
	to the target base in order to make your PT's effictive.
	If you're too far away, the PT's spend too much time
	charging in. You want them to be back approx. 10 seconds
	after they die. Any longer, and the wtemp that the base
	gained killing the PT will be gone by the time the PT
	returns. But get too close to the base, and he'll roast
	your butt. You will want 3 of 4 PT's to ogg off of you,
	right when the ogging is at it's peak. Once the base goes,
	sneak or warp away, depending on the situation. If your
	PT's are clued, they'll stick around and defend you while
	you are escaping.
</p>

<li>
<a name="UTspin"><h4>Spinning?  What?</h4>
<p>
	One fun thing about the UT is that it's the only ship with
	docking ports, and what you would call a front end. This
	makes things interesting. Ever notice that bases, SB, WB,
	JS, never rotate when they turn? However, UT's do. This
	means that the ships on them move too. If things are dull,
	whenever a ship docks on you, stop your UT and lock onto
	them. The high angular velocity of the UT tends to
	generate large quantities of humor. </p>
