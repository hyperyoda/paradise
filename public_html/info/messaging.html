<h1>Sending Messages</h1>

	If your mouse is in the tactical or galactic window, press
	the 'm' key. Your cursor will change to a text-insertion I
	bar.

<p>
	Alternatively you could move your mouse into the
	message-sending window or one of the message receiving
	windows. </p>

<h2>Addressing</h2>

	If you start your message in your team review window, it
	will automatically be addressed to your team.

<p>
	Otherwise the next character you type determines where
	your message is sent. </p>

<dl compact>

  <dt> <tt>A</tt> <dd> sends to all.

  <dt> <tt>T</tt> <dd> sends to your team.

  <dt> <tt>G</tt> <dd> sends to GOD (usually logged as a bug report).

  <dt> <tt>F</tt>,<tt>R</tt>,<tt>K</tt>,<tt>O</tt> <dd> sends to Fed,
Rom, Kli, or Ori team.

  <dt>
<tt>0</tt>,<tt>1</tt>..<tt>9</tt>,<tt>a</tt>,<tt>b</tt>..<tt>v</tt>
<dd> sends to the player with that number.

</dl>

<h2>Composition</h2>

	The rest of the characters you type are part of the
	message. There are a couple of special keys.

<dl compact>
  <dt> Return <dd> sends the message.
  <dt> Esc <dd> aborts the message without sending.
  <dt> Backspace, Delete <dd> delete character.
  <dt> ^W <dd> delete word.
  <dt> ^U, ^X <dd> kill line.
</dl>

Note: the control chacters don't work in current releases of the
client.  We're working on it... (Editor: really ? )
