<h1>Your ship</h1>

<h2>Engineering</h2>

<dl>

<dt><b>Impulse</b>
<dd> Impulse drive is used for combat and short-distance driving.

<dt><b>Afterburners</b>
<dd> Afterburners are used when you need quick accelleration.
<ul>
<li> That cloaked thing was really a warbase!
<li> You aren't moving fast enough to dodge the torp stream!
<li> That buttorper is about to go into warp and you aren't in tractor
	range yet.
</ul>

	Use it sparingly. It burns fuel and heats your engines
	<b>very</b> quickly.

<dt><b>Warp</b>

<dd> Warp drive is used for covering long distances. It
	costs some fuel to initiate, and takes a few seconds to
	power up. Normally you can't fire while warping or during
	the prep period. Normally you can't cloak during the prep
	period.

<p>
	Depending on the server settings, If you are being
	tractored or pressored when your ship is done with or just
	in warp preparation, the warp field will be disrupted.
	</p>

</dl>

	Your ship has tractor and pressor beams. The strength
	varies, being stronger on the bigger ships.

<h2>Navigation</h2>

	Your ship will turn to match the course you've set. It
	turns faster at slower speeds. Very few ships can turn
	noticably above warp 8.

<p>
	In addition to being able to set any heading, you can lock
	on to players and stellar objects. You will then
	continuously adjust course to head directly toward the
	player or stellar object. If <b>locked</b> on to a base or a
	stellar object, you will decelerate and <b>automatically dock</b>
	or go into <b>orbit</b> when close enough. </p>

<h2>Weapons</h2>

	The basic weapons are <b>phasers</b> and <b>photons</b>.
	All others are special and are not normally available when
	you get a new ship.

<dl>

<dt><b>Phaser</b>

	<dd> The basic weapon. It is direct fire and therefore
	can't be dodged. However, its damage decreases with range.

<dt><b>Photon torpedo</b>

	<dd> This is not a direct fire weapon. You have to lead
	your target. Any idiot can dodge photon torpedos at long
	range. Good players can often dodge photon torpedos at
	medium range. However, it's hard to dodge when driving
	extremely fast and a well-led stream can be the death of
	your opponent. Photon torpedos wobble in flight so their
	accuracy decreases with range. However, damage is
	<b>not</b> range dependent.

<dt><b>Plasma torpedo</b>

	<dd> Slower than a photon torpedo, these will track
	opponents, even cloaked ones. They do massive damage, but
	cost lots of fuel and <b>WTMP</b>. Typically these are not
	available on most ships till the owner has a few kills an
	returns to a shipyard for a refit.

<dt><b>Missile</b>

	<dd> These are the slowest missile weapons available
	(depending on the server setting, missiles of Bases and
	PTs are very fast), but therefore have a better turning
	radius. They have sensitive tracking sensors and can home
	on cloaked opponents. Their damage is similar to a photon
	torpedo but their cost is much greater. Like plasma
	torpedos, most ships do not come equipped with missiles.
	The owner must get kills and refit. Most ships only carry
	a limited number of missiles and must refit when the
	supply is exhausted. Exceptions to this are WB and SB.

<dt><b>Fighters</b>

	<dd> These are not normally available. They are small
	vessels that carry one photon torpedo. They are launched
	from the mother ship and track a target. When they enter
	firing range they launch their torpedo and return to base.
	While the mother ship is guiding the fighters it can not
	fire photon torpedos.

<p>
	The mother ship does not start with a full fighter bay, it
	must beam up armies from a planet. One army converts to a
	fighter squadron of 8. Surviving fighters may be beamed
	down to return the armies. </p>

</dl>

	Most missile weapons damage everyone except the teammates
	of the firer when they explode on impact. We do not offer
	any treknology to explain this and we laugh at anyone who
	attempts to. Plasma torpedos damage everyone upon
	detonation.

<p>
	You may detonate your own torpedos and fire another salvo.
	This is useful when you've missed with a salvo. This
	causes no damage to anyone. Missiles will be detonated if
	no photon torpedos are in flight. </p>

<p>
	Fighters can be recalled to base with the detonation key.
</p>

<h3>Countermeasures</h3>

	Enemy photon torpedos within a certain radius may be
	detonated by your ships close-in defenses. This results in
	reduced damage to you, but might result in the explosion
	of torps which would have otherwise missed you. These
	detonated torps now only cause damage to you and the
	firer's teammates.

	<br> (It is considered clueful to detonate enemy torps
	that would strike a valuable teammate. Bases typically
	detonate enemy torps that would strike ships docked on
	them.)

<p>
	Enemy plasma torpedos may be phasered. This causes them to
	detonate prematurely, causing damage to everyone.</p>

<p>
	Missiles may be detonated much like photon torpedos. </p>

<p>
	Fighters may be phasered.</p>

<h3>Weapons in Action (or: the ballad of R2 getting his butt kicked)</h3>
<em>(Editor: provide me with the missing pics !!!)</em>
<p>
	R2 is being phasered and torped by two enemies. He will
	last about half a second longer.
</p>
<img src="phasertorp.gif">

<p>
	R2 is cloaked and trying to reach Yosemite in order to
	bomb it, but F0 has other plans for him. Since the
	missiles point right at him, the base will soon get a
	phaser lock and then our hero is doomed.
</p>
<img src="missilecloak.gif">

<p>
	R2 has just got himself in a world of trouble. While
	attempting to scout Yosemite he encountered the warbase
	again and this time it's put a white-hot plasma torp on
	his tail. He can afterburn to outrun it or dodge it, but
	he'd better get out of the neighborhood. </p>

<h2>Defenses</h2>

	Your ship has shields and hull. If the shields are active
	and have not been destroyed then they prevent damage by
	absorbing it. If the shields are down or insufficient to
	protect you from the full damage of an attack, then the
	damage accumulates on your hull. If your hull sustains too
	much damage your ship and crew are destroyed.

<p>
	Shields are always repairing. Hull is only repaired while
	shields are down. Your ship may enter repair mode in which
	state it repairs faster, however, your shields are down,
	you are at full stop, and can not fire. To exit repair
	mode increase speed or raise shields.
</p>

<h2>Tractors</h2>

	Your ship is equipped with tractor and pressor beams.
	Tractor beams pull you and the target closer together.
	Pressor beams push you apart. Tractor beams can drag you
	out of orbit and they can also disrupt the warp
	preparation process.

<h2>Armies</h2>

	Most ships can carry armies. Most ships require that the
	player have kills before he can carry armies. The number
	of armies you can carry is usually linearly dependent upon
	the number of kills you have.

<p>
	Armies can be beamed up from planets and beamed down to
	planets. They may also be transported to and from some
	bases.
</p>

<h2>Hiding from the enemy</h2>

	All ships can cloak. In this state you are not visible on
	the enemy's tactical. Your approximate position <b>is</b>
	available on the galactic.

<h1>Planets</h1>

	Planets have four major attributes that players need to be
	aware of.

<h2>Armies</h2>

	These armies can be beamed up and down by ships on the
	same team as the planet. Enemy players can beam armies
	down to your planet and each army beamed down will kill
	one enemy army until there are none left. Planets without
	armies can be taken by beaming armies down. Then the
	planet belongs to your team.

<p>
	If there are a lot of armies on a planet (>4) then they
	can be bombed by enemy ships. This is a lot simpler (and
	more effective) than beaming armies down. </p>

<h2>Atmosphere</h2>

	Planets have different atmospheres. They are listed from
	best to worse here:

<ul>
<li> Standard
<li> Thin
<li> Tainted
<li> Toxic
</ul>

	The better the atmosphere, the faster armies grow. Toxic
	planets actually kill off armies. It's best to just leave
	them for the clueless enemy.

<h2>Surface Properties</h2>

	Many planets are worthless hunks of rock, but some have
	surface properties.

<dl>
<dt>Metal
	<dd> These planets can develop a repair station and a shipyard.
<dt>Dilithium
	<dd> These planets can develop a fuel depot.
<dt>Arable
	<dd> These planets can develop an agricultural complex.
</dl>

	Armies on a planet use surface properties to build
	facilities. An orbiting starbase also helps.

<h2>Facilities</h2>

	A few of your planets start out with facilities. The rest
	have to be built from surface properties.

<dl>
<dt>Repair
	<dd> Planets with this facility can repair orbiting ships faster.
<dt>Shipyard
	<dd> Planets with this facility can let you refit and take
	a new ship. Refitting is also the way you get special
	weapons.

<dt>Fuel
	<dd> Ships orbiting a planet with a fuel facility refuel faster.
<dt>Agri
	<dd> Planets with this attribute grow armies much faster.
</dl>

	Facilities can be bombed by the enemy. It is usually a
	good idea to protect key facilities using a base.

<h2>Revolt</h2>

	If you don't leave enough armies on a planet, it can
	revolt. The guerillas will slowly slaughter your armies
	until all are gone and the planet becomes independent.
	Listen for messages from the PREFECT. You must bring
	enough reinforcements to crush the rebellion. The current
	safe level is 3 armies.

<h2>Other balls of dust</h2>

	Planets aren't the only things floating in space. There
	are also stars and asteroid fields and planetoids.

<p>
	Don't get too close to a star. It will melt your hull.
	</p>

<p>
	You can cross great distances in no time if you find a
	wormhole-pair that leads you to where you want to fly. But
	don't enter them too fast or with too big ships, that's
	usually harmful to your ship. </p>
