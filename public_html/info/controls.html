How to Talk to Yourself</H1>

	In regular paradise there are several features available
	by sending messages to yourself. You can check the ship
	rebuild timers, enter the tournament queue, reset your
	keymap, and probably a few more that have been written
	into the server since this document was composed. To
	explore this system, send yourself the message
	<TT>help</TT>.

	<P>It's best to think of the control system as a set of
	menus. Each level of the menu has a help entry that will
	list all the other entries possible. Submenus will be have
	<TT>...</TT> after them in a <TT>help</TT> list.

	<P>To issue a command you send yourself a string of words
	that navigate through the menu system. The message
	``<TT>league time 90 30</TT>'' allows a captain to
	configure the game for a 90 minute game with a 30 minute
	overtime period. The message ``<TT>player password
	coffee</TT>'' changes a player's password to
	``coffee''.</p>
