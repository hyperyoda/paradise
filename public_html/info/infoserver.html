<h1>Planets</h1>

Planets are much more involved than in regular netrek.  They have an
extra facility added to the called the shipyard, which is where you
can enter at and refit your ships.  You can have multiple shipyards.
There are also some astronomical bodies which are stars.  <b>Do not
orbit or touch stars</b>.

<h2>Revolts</h2>

Planets may revolt if you leave less than 2 armies on them.  At 2 armies 
the chances are about 50/50.  You will first get a warning, and the 
armies will drop to 1 (they tried their best Praetor, but the 
malcontents are just too strong!)  After 1, if no re-enforcements arrive, 
it will become independent, with 1 army (and it will grow armies).

<h2>Resources</h2>

Resources are limited by the surface of the planet.  There are 3
surface types: M (Metal) which will allow Shipyard/Repair, D
(Dylithium) which will allow Fuel, and A (Arable) which will alow
Agri.  The surface type also comes into play, when figuring army
poppage, etc. (ie having an agri on a A D planet would be nice, but
not as good as having one on a AM or A planet).

<p>

Resource Times (Growing), there are a bunch of other things which modify 
this, so I will just post the raw number so that people can have an idea
of how long it takes for each surface type:  FUEL = 100, AGRI = 350, 
REPAIR = 150, SHIPYARD = 400.

<h2>Tables/Matrices</h2>

These Tables are the same tables in the server, which 
control the Chance of a planet popping armies, the 
maximum armies that type of planet can hold, and the 
army multiplier when it does pop.  

<p>

      Key to the planet tables:

<dl compact>
<dt> a = <dd> agri
<dt> f = <dd> fuel
<dt> Z = <dd> repair or shipyard or both
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>Table: <dd> Chance the Planet has of popping (chance out of 100):

</pre>

<dt>Table: <dd>Maximum planet army capacity.  Once this limit is reached, 
           no more armies can pop on that planet.  You can place more 
           than this amount on a planet.

<pre>

</pre>

</dl>

  A new popping scheme was introduced with the 2.3 server.  It is
linear, not exponential and only makes use of the max army capacity
table of the previous scheme.

<h1>Player Info</h1>



<h2>Player Stats</h2>

    Stats are soon to be figured differently.  Before it was: 

<pre>
          ratio = kills/losses
          battle = ratio + offense
          strategy = dooshes + planets + resources bombed + armies bombed
</pre>

    now it is:

<pre>
          battle = (offense + dooshes) / 2;
          strategy = (planets + resources + armies) / 6;
          special = (jsrating + wbrating + sbrating) / 3;
          ratio = (battle + strategy + special) / 3;
</pre>

Strategy is averaged by double its amount, because it has a tendency
to become very high, very fast... (which may mean that the strategy
requirement for ranks will go up).

<h2>Ranks</h2>

<h2>Royalty</h2>

Royalty doesn't mean anything, other than Emperor.  The Emperor Royalty 
was created in the thought that all server admins (even if they aren't 
an admin at that site) would be an Emperor, so that the chances of 
having somebody who has a little control over the game would be in
the game would be higher.

<p>

This is so that if mindless drivel decide to 'crash' the game, there is 
hopefully somebody around who can handle it.  We *may* allow anybody to 
choose any royalty they desire, other than Emperor--to augument their
player name (such as Dread Pirate Lynx).  


Royalties:
<menu>
<li> Wesley (an insult reserved for players who annoy Emperors)
<li> Centurion
<li> Praetor
<li> Emperor

<h1>Ships</h1>

These are out-of-date ship stats in a somewhat readable format.
Sorry, we're pretty damn busy and would happily accept some help to
update this.
<br>  The first bit of text is some notes dealing with ships,
and ship play.  Following this are documents on playing different ship
types.

<p>

<dl>

<dt>Cloak Cost: <dd>Due to warp, the cost for cloaking has been
slightly altered. Now, it is a multiplier of the speed you are
travelling.  This means it is possible to go warp 1 in some ships, and
regenerate, But at higher speeds, the cost becomes exorbitant.

<dt>Explosion damage: <dd>is now calculated as a percantage of the
fuel you carry, rather than a set number.  Appx 75% of your fuel does
the same amount of damage as an old explosion. (Old explosions are
75:SC; 100:DD,CA,BB,AS, 200:SB)

<dt>Warp Initialize: <dd>the initialization time, in ticks, the
seconds are guestimates warp initialize cost is roughly 1/5 the ships
maxfuel

<dt>Bomb: <dd>the ships bomb rating.

  Notes:
    The frigate stands between the Cruiser and BB (so much so
    that when I statted it out, I just averaged nearly all of 
    the scores together from the two ships).  It is *not* a Galaxy
    class ship, because people were confusing it with a Galaxy
    class ship, we changed its name to Frigate.

  Maximum armies: 20 
  Manuverabilty: Poor/Fair
  Acceleration: Fair
  Deceleration: Good
  Tractor/Pressor strength: Poor/Fair

  Notes:
    The best and most deadly usage of a AS is in unison with a JumpShip


THE JUMPSHIP (JS)


  Cruising Speed: 6-10
  Max Impulse Speed: 20
  Warp Speed: 45
  Warp Initialize Time: 7 (a minute seconds)
  Warp Initialize Speed: 2
  Max Afterburner Speed: 60
  Internal damage/shields: 60/5
  Torpedo Speed: 18
  Maximum fuel: 50000

  Torpedo damage/fuel: 5/1000
  Phaser damage: close range: 15-25
  Phaser cost: 500
  Bomb: *cannot orbit* 

  Maximum armies: *cannot carry armies* 
  Manuverabilty: Good
  Acceleration: Excellent
  Deceleration: Excellent
  Tractor/Pressor strength: Excellent
  Docks: 4
  Defenders required: 3
  Planets required: 0
  Rebuild time: 12 minutes (this is a recent change)
  Maximum Number: 1
  Rank required: 1 (Specialist)

  Notes:
   *The JS is an engine, a DAMN big engine, with four docks on it.  The
    weaponry is thrown on, on the side.  Tearing somebody off a dock
    (this includes all bases) damages the ship carrying it, but is an
    often used tactic with the JS (quick AS depositing).
   *The JS can refuel.


THE WARBASE (WB)


  Combat Speed(s): 2 (2-3)
  Cruising Speed (without shields): 3
  Max Impulse Speed: 3
  Warp Speed: 6
  Warp Initialize Time: 100 (12 seconds)
  Warp Initialize Speed: 2
  Max Afterburner Speed: 5
  Internal damage/shields: 250/500
  Torpedo Speed: 15
  Maximum fuel: 50000

  Torpedo damage/fuel: 45/450
  Phaser damage: close range: 135
  Phaser cost: 1150
  Bomb: 90

  Maximum armies: *cannot carry armies* 
  Tractor/Pressor strength: Excellent
  Docks: 2
  Defenders required: 3
  Planets required: 4
  Rebuild time: 15 minutes (this is a recent change)
  Maximum Number: 1
  Rank required: 1 (Specialist) (Later will move to 3, Midshipman)

  Notes:
   *The Warbase is a weapons/bombing platform.  It cannot carry armies, but
    can orbit planets, and is extremely deadly when bombing, having a chance
    of bombing to 1 army.
   *Phasers and Torps are both extremely potent near a Warbase, but they loose
    their effectiveness with range rather quickly.
   *the Warbase Can fuel and repair, but cannot refit planets.  It can orbit.


THE STARBASE (SB)


  Combat Speed(s): 2 (2-3)
  Cruising Speed (without shields): 3
  Max Impulse Speed: 3
  Warp Speed: 6
  Warp Initialize Time: 100 (12 seconds)
  Warp Initialize Speed: 2
  Max Afterburner Speed: 5
  Internal damage/shields: 500/600
  Torpedo Speed: 14
  Maximum fuel: 60000

  Torpedo damage/fuel: 30/300
  Phaser damage: close range: 120
  Phaser cost: 960
  Bomb: 50

  Maximum armies: 25
  Tractor/Pressor strength: Excellent
  Docks: 6
  Defenders required: 4
  Planets required: 7
  Rebuild time: 30 minutes (this is a recent change)
  Maximum Number: 1
  Rank required: 2 (Cadet) (later will move to 4, Ensign Jnr.)


THE JUMPSHIP (working as a team)

The Jumpship probably requires more teammwork to pull off correctly than any
other ship in Netrek.  It can carry up to 4 passengers and can hit warp 45
(impulse 20, afterburn 60)

</pre>

<hr>

<h2>Movement/Communication</h2>

Moving while in the JS is a tricky situation.  If the team is a scumm team
(taking planets/carriers) the enemy will probably be out to get you.  This
means that you absolutely have to move fast.  Most directions should be decided
by the carrier.  If the carrier doesn't give a direction before they dock, the
JS should simply scream away, and change course at a later time.

<p>

Now, to the carrier:  Use simple short commands, the best thing to do is to
give polar coordinates and then give more detailed directions later, such as:

<pre>
	R0->R3  n
	Jumpship->R3  Twinkerbell (R0) has successfully docked on bay 2 Captain.
</pre>

at this point the JS pilot should simply scream to the north (only
avoiding stars and ugly looking enemies).  Note: the most frustrating
thing is to tell a js captain to move, and have him sit there doing
nothing.  Warp initialize takes 7 ticks (less than a second).
Therefore, the best thing to do is to first use afterburners to get
away, then switch to warp at a later point.  (n = north, s = south, e
= east, w = west--don't use galaxy rotation, it throws this all off :)
then, after you are away from danger the carrier can give better
directions, say system first, then planet:

<pre>
	R0->R3  dec twi
</pre>

	Which means the dec system, planet twi
<p>
	Other things that the carrier could say would be:

<h2>Dropping/Picking up a Carrier</h2>

	if you are a JS pilot, and you are carrying an AS, the best thing to do
is to drop them ON TOP of the planet.  Don't tractor them off you as you take
damage (it hoses the docking bay).  What you should do is decelerate do warp 3,
and come to a virtual stop on the planet, then all the AS has to do is to lock
onto the planet and they have immediate orbit.  You must move fast because you
only have 50 damage, and if the planet has lots of armies you can die rather
quickly.

<p>

	If there are enemies in the area, cloak, and stay near the carrier, if
they are really near the planet, uncloak and try to lure them away (people have
this habit of trying to kill the nearest JS, since they are so annoying).

<p>

	When a ship comes to dock on you slow to warp 2 (its easier).  If the
AS is near you tractor them to you, but TURN OFF your tractors before they are
within a few millimeters of you (Same goes for the AS).  The best thing to do
is to be on the planet when they are ready to leave, so they can do the same
thing you do on dropping them off (just lock onto you, and you fly by
them--they don't have to move (AS's accelerate damn slow)).

<p>

	Also, while a carrier is dropping if there are enemies do your best to
keep them from firing on the planet.  Tractor them away, do whatever you can,
but mess up their aim, etc (don't fire torps, its a waste of time/fuel/wtemp). 
If your real bored its alway's fun to tractor enemies into the stars :)

<h2>Configuration</h2>

	There are several different ships which can be good with a JS,
depending upon the situation.

<dl>
<dt>	BEGINNING of the game:

<dd> Have a AS/SC/heavy.  The heavy ship is simply an opportunity
escort/defender/bomber/ogger.  CAs/FRs work good.  This config is good
for the beginning as the SC has to do nothing other than be on the JS
(the pilot will be doing most of the command decisions in this
situation.).  All players on the JS should be checking planets as they
fly over them to see if they are worth taking/bombing.  <b>If</b> they
are worth bombing(and they are an enemy planet) the AS will drop off
and bomb with either the help of the heavy, or the defense of the
heavy.  The SC can usually scout near planets while they are busy (SC:
don't go too far, the JS cannot wait for you to return).

<dt>	MID game, with good scouting by other teammates:

<dd>	AS (and possible heavy).  The AS needs kills and armies (even if its 1
kill).  This is the basic scumm setup, and all the basic rules apply, take
planets strategically, leaving the enemies with bad planets which don't pop
frequently and are hard to defend.  (If somebody on the team is deciding which
planets to take, listen, don't go off on your own).

<dt>	END game, LPS:

<dd>	well, I've the slightest idea for this situation, most JS captains I
know won't dare get close enough.  I would say have 1 AS(carrier) and 3
heavies.  The 3 heavies act as decoy's, going off in different preset
directions and clearing the planet (same with JS, at this point you can loose
it) while the AS attempts to take.

<dt>	SCREAMING OGG:

<dd>	4 BB's.  Best used against bases, everybody cloaks and screams in, the
BB's need to constantly det, and hope that the SB captain doesn't get a good
lock.  The JS doesn't do mega explosion damage anymore, so you have two
choices, if you are willing to sacrifice everybody, uncloak firing everything
right onto of the SB, and try to get EVERYBODY to explode on the base. 
Otherwize use the JS as a ogg shuttle, and drop the 4 cloaked BB's off right
next to the Base, and have them do a regular ogg.

</dl>

	well, i know there is more, but this is all spur of the moment, hope it
makes sense :)

    It has come to my attention that some of our troops are not up to the
usual high standards of the empire's military.  This is intolerable.  We must
wipe out those pesky pretenders to my title.  I AM Emperor Kaiban, ruler of
the galaxy, and I will not accept anyone else calling themself emperor in
MY galaxy.  If someone wishes to call themself emperor, well, then let them
go find another galaxy.  This one is mine. 
<p>
    Today we launch plan Z to exert my authuority across the entire region of
known space. The troops  must be ready to exterminate the enemy.  As a last
minute detail, all empire troops should update their knowledge of miltitary
science.
<p>
    I, therefore, decree that all troops must review the enclosed information
to brush up on their knowledge.  So let it be written, so let it be done.

     Begin: introduction
     Course: ID# 2450
</pre>

     Hi!  I am your instructor.  As you might have surmised, I am not a real
person.  I am an artificial intelligence entity.  What you are seeing is a
holographic body.  I will be your instructor in the arts of war.

<p>

     Hey!!  What do you mean my body is green?  Green is a perfectly fine
color.  The emperor has declared green to be one of his favorite colors.
If you don't like it, I can introduce you to a re-education program I
know.   Anyway, I wanted to be blue, but the engineers did not have any
blue holographic imagers on hand.

<p>

     Now, enough of this.  I must teach you what you need to know, or the 
emperor might have me imprisoned in a digital kitchen appliance.  

<p>

  On to the lesson.

<hr>

<h1>The Emperor's Galaxy</h1>

<p>

     The galaxy has nine known stars.  There are shown 
on your space ship's screen with the pictures to the 
right...the RIGHT you eediot.  That's your left.  Wake 
up--(smack) (smack)--this is important.  Ever since 
planet Hawiian Tropic had an unfortunate nuclear accident, 
the galaxy has suffered a star screen shortage.  Running 
over a star can result in extreme sunburn to the captain 
and the crew.  Therefore, it is strictly forbidden to 
take one of the emperor's ships too close to a star.

<p>

     Each star has a cluster of planets around it.  Almost all planets
are in clusters excpet for a few errant ones, which the emperor plans
to have demolished to make way for the new inter-galactic super-highway
as soon as the other petty governments in the galaxy are dealt with.

<p>

     You know the emperor has decreed that all planets are equal, but some
planets are more equal than others.  You certainly would not want to spend 
your shore leave on Arrakis.  You must be able to determine which planets 
to drop imperial troops on, so we'll start with planetary atmospheres.

<p>

    Every planet has an atmosphere and there are four types: toxic, tainted,
thin, and standard.  Toxic atmospheres might be fine for Rigellian leg
worms, but YOU would not want to live there...and you certainly would not
want to raise kids on a panet with a poison atmosphere.  But, being
in the employ of the emperor, sometimes you just will not have a choice.


<p>

                       The best type of atmosphere for a planet is, of course, 
                    a standard one--signified as STND on the ship's sensors.  
                    The next best is a thin atmosphere, which, suprisingly
                    enough is designated THIN on the sensors.  Not really 
                    hospitable, but tolerable is a tainted atmosphere, TNTD.  
                    And of course every soldier's nightmare is being posted
                    to a planet with a toxic atmosphere (TOXC).

<p>

                         The type of atmosphere a planet has and the resources 
                    that have been built on it determine how fast the planet 
                    pops and how many armies the planet can hold.  A planet 
                    with an agri and a shipyard built on it pops a lot faster 
                    and can support more armies than a planet with a tainted 
                    atmosphere and a repair station on it.

<p>

    Toxic atmospheres are particularily bad because they slowly kill off the
armies posted to them until there are only three armies left, the ones who
can fit inside the standard-sized military issue fortress.

<p>

    Planets with standard atmospheres are rare and prized by the emperor.  
If you discover one, take it to further the noble objectives of our beloved
emperor.

<p>

     I know you learned this in your academy planetary geology classes; but
let's review it, just in case you spent your time chasing after Denebian
women instead of attending classes.  (The low level of the troops the emperor,
bless him, has been sending me lately just boggles the mind).

<p>

     Now we come to attributes of planets.  Galactic geologist have currently
identified three planetary attributes: dylthium crystal deposits, metal
deposits, and arable land.  

<p>

     First off, dylithium crystals--What?  NO, FOOL!  You most certainly
cannot give a ring with a diythium crystal on it to your girl friend.
(smack)  (smack)  (Kapow)  What type of twisted sicko are you?  Dilythium
crystals are poisonous!  Deposits of dilythium crystals on a planet have
the side effect of creating a toxic atmosphere.

<p>

     The existence of dilithium crstals on a planet 
allows a fuel depot to be built there.  I don't know if 
I have to remind you of this, but your trusty space ship 
needs dilythium to get from one point in space to 
another. No dilithium, no fuel depot.  No fuel depot, 
you no go go.

<p>
   As any member of the Imperial Youth would know:
dilythium deposits on a planet are indicated by a 
capital D in the surface attributes of a planet info 
window or planet list. 

<p>

     Now, onto metal deposits.  Metal deposits are easy to understand.  
Even you should be able to.  Your ship is made of metal, therefore you 
need metal to build ships.  You also need metal to repair ships.  So a 
repair station or a shipyard can only be built on a planet with metal 
deposits, which are identified with a capital letter M on the info window 
and the planet list.

<p>

     The last known planetary attribute, as of yet, is arable land.  Arable
land is more than just soil, of course.  It also takes into account the
availability of water and whether edible plants grow there.  To build
an AGRI planet requires that the planet be arable.  There are not many of
planets in the galaxy with arable land, especially not many with both
arable land and a standard atmosphere.  If you find one, claim it in the name
of the Emperor immediately...or sooner if possible.

<p>

<h2>Imperial Construction</h2>

<p>

    It is the goal of the emperor to control the whole of the galaxy.  There-
fore you should try to take all planets in the galaxy.  Planets with toxic 
atmosperes and no attributes are not particularily valuable, so you do not
have to waste troops on them.  We'll come back to take take them after we
wipe out the pretenders to the royal throne.

<p>

    Once you take a planet, the imperial armies will begin to construct
resources on the planet.  This contruction takes some time, but the construct-
ion goes faster the more armies that are on the planet.  If an imperial
starbase is orbiting the planet, construction is much, much faster. 
	
<p>

    There are four types of resources that can be constructed on a planet:
fuel depots, repair stations, agricultural facilities, and shipyards.  As I
mentioned earlier, fuel depots can only be built on a planet with dilythium
deposits, repair stations and shipyards cn only be constructed on planets
with metal deposits, and agricultural facilities can only be constructed
on planets with arable land.  
	
<p>

    Fuel depots are constructed the fastest; repair stations take a little
longer.  Once a repair station is constructed, the imperial engineers will
begin to turn it into a shipyard.  It takes the longest to construct agri-
cultural facilities.
	
<p>

    Agricultural facilities are very valuable because they produce troops
faster than non-agri planets.  And the emperor can always use more cannon
fodder--er, soldiers like yourself.
	
<p>

     Shipyards are where we build all of our starcraft.   Since usually
launch new ships from a shipyard, it is important to have shipyards on the
front line.  We need to be able to get new ships into combat as fast as
                   possible.  Shipyards are also used to repair ships at 
                   and to refit to shiny new ships.  There have been some
                   upgrades to the sensor display of new ships to indicate
                   whether or not a planet has a shipyard on it. They are
                   designated with a gear on your planetary display (picture 
                   to the right).  
	
<p>



<h2>Bombing the Hated Enemy</h2>

	
<p>

  As our troops strive to build resources on planets, so do the troops of
the enemy strive to build resources on their own planets.  When you get the
chance you should bomb the enemies planets.  If you bomb enough, you can 
destroy the enemy's resources.  Even if you do not have time to completely
destroy a facility, you can bomb the planet to set back the enemy's construct-
ion process.  Or bomb it a little at one time, then come back and finish the
job later.
	
<p>

    Each ship type has a different capacity to bomb armies and men off enemy
planets.  To bomb off resources it is best to use an assault ship or a battle
ship. Though all ships can bomb off resources; it just may take a lot longer.
If you can get a warbase behind enemy lines, that will provide the ultimate 
in resource bombing.

<p>


<h2>Planetary Revolution</h2>

<p>

  Sshhhh.  Not so loud.  He might hear you.  Don't stare, fool!  The
one over near the corner.  He looks like a revolutionary to me.  Hide
your empire troop badge.  Jupitor, and Venus.  Do I have to explain
everything to you?

<p>
     Ships cost money.  Now, we both 
know that all good citizens enjoy 
paying 80% taxes to the empire 
bureaucracy--which, of course, goes 
to purchase worthwhile things, like 
Clinton's hair dye. But there are 
always a few who stir up trouble. 
Look at this one to the left  -->
Notice his shifty eyes, whacked out
long hair.  He's obviously a rebel.
Probably hiding out on a college
campus, too.

<p>

    So, now that we have learned how
to identify rebels, I will cover the
official Imperial policy:

<p>

    It is official Imperial policy to
leave at least three armies on a
planet.  Less than that and it is
almost certain that the revolutionaries
will rise up and try to overthrow our wonderful imperial government.  
The prefect of the planet will give warnings so you can bring in re-
enforcements, but don't delay; planets are usually crawling with 
guerrillas.  And don't flash your bureaucratic ID card around while 
on shore leave:  It's just not safe.



<p>


<h2>Withdrawing from a Planet</h2>

<p>

           (Also known as advancing to the rear, but never, 
              under imperial decree, as retreating.)

<p>


    Sometimes, in the course of war, a planet may come under an onslaught
of the enemy that is so fierce that the empire may have to temporarily
abandon a planet or two.  Under these circumstances, the imperial troops
on a planet should be saved if possible.  All the armies should be taken
off a doomed planet and the resources should be bombed off to prevent them
from falling into the hands of the enemy.


<p>





<h2>Gathering Information on Planets</h2>


<p>

    The military needs the most up to date information possible about
what the state of enemy planets.  You can get information on a planet
by orbiting it.  Once you leave orbit you never get an update on the 
status of the planet until you or one of the empire's other ships orbit
the planet again.  The age of the information the empire curently has
on a planet is indicated on the info window and planet list of your
sensors.

<p>



<h2>Piloting the Emperor's Spacecraft</h2>

<p>


  Your trusty spacecraft has three types of engine speeds: impulse, after-
burners, and warp.  You can use impulse by hitting the keys from 0-20.  
Impulse engines should be used for travelling short distances and maneauvering
in combat.  Afterburners are started with the ` key.  THey quickly accellerate
the ship, but guzzle fuel and heat the engines very fast.  They are best
used to dodge torps.  The warp drive is started by hitting the - key.
There is a one time fuel cost for engaging the warp engines.  After they
are engaged, your ship will slow down, and there will be a several second
power buildup before you take off.


<p>



<h2>Ship type Explanations:</h2>

    You should be familiar with most of these ships.  The basic
statistics for the Scout, Destroyer, Cruiser, Battleship, Assault Ship,
and Starbase are the same.

<dl>
<dt>    JUMPSHIP

<dd>         This ship is designed to carry people somewhere, fast.  It can
go warp 45, and carry 4 other ships.  It has virtually no weapons, so it
is best if you learn to work in coordination with another player, to
fight in battles.

<dt>    FRIGATE

<dd>         This ship is also known as the Flagship, or Heavy Cruiser.  It
is simply a Cruiser which is stripped of its peacetime capabilities, and
built for battle.  It is not quite as strong as a Battleship, but it is
stronger than a Cruiser.

<dt>    WARBASE

<dd>         The Warbase is a planetary assault platform.  It can go warp 6,
and orbit/bomb planets.  However, it cannot carry armies to take planets
(because it has no space, with the bombing bay's and heavy armor).  It
has relatively small shields (for a base) but an extremely strong hull
(to resist the planetary retaliation when its shields are down).

</dl>


<h2>Rising Through the Ranks</h2>


    When you first join the emperor's glorious miltitary, you are of
course a recruit.  By participating in wars you can rise in rank.  There's
the list of ranks and the requirements for a promotion on the next page, so

</pre>

<dl>
<dt>  genocides	<dd>   The number of genocides you have participated in, win or
               lose.

<dt>  DI (Destruction Inflicted) 	<dd> A running, non-decreasing total of
               destruction inflicted.  You get DI for many things, including
               destroying enemy ships, bombing armies, bombing resources,
               killing armies that are being carried by an enemy ship, and
               taking planets.




<dt>  Battle rating	<dd>Your battle rating is a sum of two other ratings: ratio
               and offense.  Your ratio is how many kills you have divided
               by losses.  Your offense rating is a comparison of the rate
               you destroy enemy ships at compared with the rate of the 
               average soldier.  A battle rating of 2.0 means you are
               average.

<dt>  Strategy rating	<dd> The strategy rating is made up of four other ratings:
               planet rating, doosh rating, army bombing rating, and resource
               bombing rating.  Your planet rating is a comparison of the
               rate at which you take planets compared with the rate of other
               troops.  The doosh rating is a rating of how many armies you
               kill while they are being transported.  The army bombing
               rating is a rating based on the number of foreign troops you
               bomb off planets; and the resource bombing rating is a rating
               of how many resources you bomb off enemy planets.  All these
               ratings have an average of 1.0.  If your strategy rating is
               4.0, then you are doing an average job.

<dt>  Special ship rating	<dd> The special ship rating is made up of ratings of how
               you do piloting the three types of special ships: starbases,
               warbases, and jumpships.  For starbases and warbases your
               rating is based on your ratio compared with that of other
               players.  For the jumpships, your rating is based on the number
               of planets you help other team members take.

</dl>

  You are promoted, when all your stats are above the minimum values that
are included in the rankings chart.
