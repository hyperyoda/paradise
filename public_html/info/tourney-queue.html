<h1>Motivation</h1>

	Paradise doesn't have a huge following like normaltrek
	yet. The tournament thresholds for paradise will be also
	larger than normaltrek. (normaltrek has a threshold of 4,
	paradise could have 6 or 8.) Waiting for tournament mode
	is a fairly boring passtime.

<p>
	There are a number of hazards for the player who is
	waiting for T-mode. If he wants to stay alert he can
	prevent them all, but who wants to waste all day waiting
	for a game that might never materialize? You just iconify
	it. </p>

<p>
	Without a crew your ship is vulnerable to clueless twinks
	who drive up and shoot you full of torps. You can get
	clobbered by Dread Pirate Roberts. You can get caught in
	the middle of a dogfight between two players. You're dead.
	Basically little things that don't interest you but
	require your attention. </p>

<h1>Solution</h1>

	Create a new mode for players who are just waiting for T.
	In this mode they can converse, or just ignore everything.
	There's no danger of getting blasted to shreds and
	Auto-Quitted. You can reenter the game at any time. If
	enough people arrive to create tournament mode, all the
	people on the queue will be notified and will join.

<p>
	This mode looks like the outfit screen. You can read the
	MOTD (what a good idea!), send and receive messages,
	reenter the game at any time, or just <i>iconify the
	client!</i>
</p>

<p>
	If someone sends a personal message to you, your client
	will beep to notify you. (We're working on a mod that will
	sound the X server bell at several frequencies in sequence
	to create an unmistakable sound).
</p>

<p>
	If T-mode starts, you will be placed on the outfit screen.
	This causes the automatic deiconification of your client
	so you will NOT miss this event.
</p>

<h1>Sounds great! How do I try it?</h1>

	On any paradise server, send yourself the message
	``<tt>queue</tt>'' or ``<tt>tq</tt>''. Then just iconify
	the client and go about your normal work. If T-mode
	occurs, hop in and kick butt.

<p>
	Sorry, this isn't available on normaltrek servers. If you
	want stability, try normaltrek. If you want whiz-bang
	ultracool hacks and don't mind the occasional sharp edge,
	play Paradise!
