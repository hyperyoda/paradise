<h1>The History of Paradise Netrek</h1>

	This document is incomplete. We need some input from Heath
	Kehoe, Mike McGrath and Bill Dyess as to what they think
	some major milestones are.

<h2> by Brandon: </h2>

<dl>
<dt>November 92
<dd>
	Larry Denys &amp; Brandon Gillespie (me) begin talking
	about the lack of variety with Netrek &amp; how it could
	be much cooler.

<dt>January 93:  
<dd>
	We've been talking for a while, Kurt has also had bunches
	of ideas. I begin downloading server sources and sifting
	Through various different ones. I run the flint source on
	paradise.declab.usu.edu.

<dt>February 93:
<dd>
	I finally manage to lure Larry and Kurt into the project,
	playing around starts. We toss the flint source and begin
	with the bronco source for both. Kurt does a majority of
	the client interior work, Larry is on the server. We
	discard the bronco client for the hadley client.

<dt>~March-April:
<dd>
	Paradise I has been extremely popular, primarily due to it
	being so different yet not complete chaos (some would beg
	to differ =)

<p>
	The dates get vague here. Paradise I was the initial hacks
	after the initial hacks we withdrew the actual code into
	development and left Paradise I for itself. </p>

<p>
	Background on the situation at USU: Games are illegal in
	the labs we are developing in. However we had permission
	to run the server on one of them (paradise.declab.usu.edu)
	after hours. Dr. Larre Egbert, Computer Science professor
	was the original professor who ran the campaign against
	Netrek (as the no games rule was targeted towards Netrek).
	He claimed that stats had been taken and Netrek was taking
	up 60% of the available campus Network. (later legitimate
	stats have proven that if every student attending USU
	simultaneously played netrek it wouldn't even take up 5%
	of the available bandwidth). </p>

<p>
	Dr Egbert heard of the server we were running on
	paradise.declab.usu.edu and began pulling strings again. I
	received a letter quickly written explaining the situation
	(which was very tense), within 15 minutes the currently
	running game was nuked and all code, files, etc were
	tarred backed onto floppy and removed off the system, and
	we went on spring break. </p>

<p>
	After spring break I began looking for alternate sites for
	the server, as we were about to release paradise II. Mike
	Lutz and Heath Kehoe ran it for a brief while alternate to
	netrek.icaen.uiowa.edu. Rob Forsman stepped in and started
	up the first full time functional paradise since the
	initial paradise.declab.usu.edu had been shutdown at
	mole.cis.ufl.edu, later renamed to netrek.cis.ufl.edu.
	</p>

<p>
	We found another machine (recumbent.declab.usu.edu)
	through the graces of Bob Bayne, Manager of Academic
	services at USU. Paradise II was released. </p>

<dt>June ~ current:
<dd>
	Kurt dropped out of the project, a development team was
	essentially formed between others (formed around april
	actually) With Rob and Larry at the core. Larry left the
	team when summer started.

<dt>December 93:
<dd>
	recumbent.declab.usu.edu can no longer handle the usage of
	the server (it was a weak machine). Charles Swenson, (aka
	alfven) a professor in the Engineering Department at USU
	offered a home for the server, with more memory.

<p>
	pippin became the new home. </p>

</dl>

so basically:
<ul>
<li> paradise.declab.usu.edu (original) (DEC 5000/125)

<li> recumbent.declab.usu.edu (DEC 3000/125)
                           |
<li> pippin.declab.usu.edu (Sparc running Solaris)

</ul>

<h2>by Bob Forsman</h2>


	Arctica was named after an Empire country I played in a
	once-per-day Australian game. It was first brought up on
	mole.cis.ufl.edu. The sysadmin was gracious enough to give
	me a cname: netrek.cis.ufl.edu which came in handy when he
	relocated it to floater.cis.ufl.edu, which was a
	consultant-only sparc. Later he decided to declare floater
	a lot more unstable and changed the cname to
	beach.cis.ufl.edu where it lives today. Beach was upgraded
	to 2 processors late February 1994.

<h3>Paradise 1</h3>

	March 19: Bob Forsman retrieves the 1.05 source code.

<p>
	March 23: Bob asks to be added to the paradise mailing
	list because he now hosts paradise's old database. </p>

<h3>Paradise 2.0 (1.99x)</h3>

	These dates are from files I have in my directory. They
	probably lag the source release by a little bit since I
	didn't maintain the source archive back then.

<ul>
  <li> March 31: 1.99
  <li> April 2: 1.991
  <li> April 5: 1.992
  <li> April 7: 1.993
  <li> April 9: 1.994
  <li> April 21(client) 23(server): 1.995
  <li> April 28(client only): 1.996
  <li> May 28: 1.997
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Paradise 2.01</h3>

	The 2.01 server was released probably in late June, or
	early July. It was called 2.01 because the 1.99x series
	was accidentally released under the name 2.0 at one point.
	The 2.01 server was released some time before July 15th. I
	can't set a better date because the earliest patch is
	dated July 15th and the full source tar is dated August
	19th (implying that it was compiled/altered well after the
	release). The client was released before July 2nd. Similar
	dating problems apply to it since the full source tar was
	the only base archive of 2.01 client source.

<p>
	First prototype for the tournament queue was developed at
	Arctica and announced on 4th of July. The client side was
	released as 2.01 patch 4 on 9th of July but didn't
	completely work until 2.01 patch 6 released on 17th of
	July. Server 2.01 patch2 and 3 were released the same day
	and were the first release of the server-side TQ code.
	</p>

<p>
	The league server was first tested in a game at Arctica on
	24th of July. Brandon in his .Lynx incarnation was the
	primary planet scummer for the Orions while Muckraker (an
	Admiral who kicked my ass all over the place when I played
	sturgeon-style) made an appearance to help out Hammor's
	team. The first league server was released as 2.01 patch 5
	on 27th of July. </p>

<hr>

<h3>Paradise 2.1</h3>

	2.1 was released around August 10th. Shortly afterwards
	Brandon suggested giving our clients an expire time.

<p>
	The high scores program, which prints out who's been
	playing the best recently, was released in August. </p>

<p>
	The idea for game parameters was introduced in late July.
	The first fragments of code were released on the 15th of
	August in server 2.1 patch 2. </p>

<p>
	Brandon created the info server on 17th of August. It ran
	on recumbent on port 3000. It was a normal netrek server
	that was closed all the time and had information in the
	MOTD. </p>

<p>
	Mike McGrath's fighters are incorporated into the mainline
	source by Robert Forsman on August 29th in server 2.1
	patch 6. Fighters were determined to be extremely
	unbalanced and have been shelved. The code is still in
	there, though. </p>

<p>
	September 13th saw a posting from Adam Harrison saying
	(among other things) that he and Shawn Bairds had
	incorporated sturgeon upgrades into his copy of the
	Paradise source. Brandon had a coronary. This mod was
	quickly flamed out of existence, with no hard feelings
	towards the misguided implementors. </p>

<p>
	September 24th: Bill Dyess sends his first client patch to
	Robert Forsman. Setting a pattern for future patches from
	Auburn, it was enormous. It incorporated a lot of ideas
	from BRM, but (in typical Paradise style) better. Its
	final form was released on October 7th as 2.1 patch 2.
	<br> The interval between 2.1p1 and 2.1p2 was ~37 days,
	the longest interval between client patches to date. Patch
	2 was followed by patch 3ufl by a couple of hours. </p>

<p>
	Oct 1: Another record hiatus of 31 days between server
	patches is ended with the release of server patches 8ia
	and 9ufl. September was just a dead month. </p>

<hr>

<h3>Paradise 2.2</h3>

	The 2.2 server baseline was released on October 29th by
	Brandon. The 2.2 client baseline was released on November
	5th by Bill with another huge wad of way-cool hacks
	including macros.

<p>
	Late November '93 the Paradise League Council (PLC)
	actually starts doing things. Members vote on which
	features will be part of standard Paradise and which will
	be off by default. November 30th, Brandon posts a schedule
	of league games. The teams are: .D.O.T.S., Future Business
	Majors, &lt;this space for rent&gt;, and The Hammor Party.
	</p>

<p>
	December 11th saw the first league game: &lt;this space
	for rent&gt; -vs- The Hammor Party. The controversial
	Light Cruisers had been enabled by the PLC and Mike Lutz
	hadn't heard about it. Mike was so pissed he dissolved
	&lt;this space for rent&gt; and refused to play Paradise
	League "in this jello for rules invirernment". Heath Kehoe
	(a teammate of Mike's from the same university) less than
	an hour afterwards declares that he is tired of his ideas
	being ignored by the other developers and resigns from the
	PLC. The other members are somewhat confused by all this.
	</p>

<p>
	December 12th sees the first prototype observer mode at
	UFL's experimental server. It is relased in server 2.2
	patch 8 with many other enhancements to the league server.
	</p>

<p>
	December 16th sees the integration of Eden's PT boats and
	Utility vessels into the mainline source. </p>

<p>
	December 28th sees the release of the client-side observer
	code. </p>

<hr>
Hasta, 1993.  Happy New Year 1994
<hr>

	January 6th: client 2.2 patch 8 adds the kitchen sink in
	response to Andy McFadden's (?) sarcastic comment on rgn.
	</p>

<p>
	PLC has its first electronic meeting on January 10th at a
	MOO running on Recumbent. These become a weekly affair.
	Those who attend decide the fate of paradise. Those who
	don't are not allowed to complain. </p>

<p>
	January 17th: PLC ratifies server 2.2 patch 11 as the
	official league source for the Winter 1994 season. They
	also ratify a rulebook and shortly afterwards post a new
	schedule to begin the Winter '94 season. Teams are: Future
	Business Majors, Make Money Fast, and The Hammor Party.
	</p>

<p>
	January 19th: Mike McGrath integrates Broncoish capability
	into the server baseline as 2.2 patch 12. </p>

<hr>
<h3>Paradise 2.3</h3>

	March 3rd: Brandon prepares a 2.3 server baseline and
	hands it off to Rob Forsman. A few bugs are discovered in
	the implementation of a new non-exponential army growth
	scheme and are fixed before the source is indented and
	tarred. It is announced that afternoon.

<p>
	March 10th: 35 days after patch 10ufl, client hackers fire
	off a quick round of patches. This sets a new record for
	delay between client patches. Client baseline 2.3 is then
	released. It incorporates more COW features to help make
	paradise more popular with the normaltrek crowd.
</p>

<p>
	March 11th: Joe Rumsey is finally added to
	paradise-workers. He had been hacking an Amiga client for
	paradise outside the umbrella of paradise-workers but
	wanted his changes to become part of the mainline source.
</p>

<p>
	March 23rd: Joe Rumsey provides the first amiga binary for
	paradise to be archived on ftp.cis.ufl.edu.
</p>

<p>
	April 4th: Larry Denys is sick of twinks on pippin. He
	can't seem to get the preexisting clue checking code to
	work the way he wants so he writes a quick hack of his
	own. The PLC responds by upgrading the preexisting clue
	checker. The concept of clue checking is the subject of
	quite a bit of discussion on the mailing lists.
</p>

<p>
	April 7th: UFL ends a record streak of server patches
	starting with 2.2p17 (Feb 28) and ending with 2.3p5 (Apr
	3) by releasing 2.3p6usu,ufl, which incorporates some
	designs from Brandon&amp;Co. Other hackers have not had to
	release patches because they haven't released anything
	broken.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>The saga continues: Part 3</h2>

	May 6th - August 2: Server patches 7 through 13 are
	released from various sources, which will be documented
	here later. Client patches 2 through 9 are released as
	well; development on a new top secret client begins.

<p>
	August 3 - Bill releases server patch 13 incorporating
	Warp Zones, improved floating point performance, and some
	hacks to make it compile under Linux. </p>

<p>
	August 3 - August 15: Rob and Brandon announce that they
	are leaving paradise development. WWW and ftp site are
	transferred to Bob Glamm. Current UFL WWW pages &amp; ftp
	site to remain active at least through the opening of Bob
	G's WWW pages &amp; ftp site. </p>

<p>
	August 20 - After a painful experience with diff's
	whitespace option, Mike releases server patch 14; this
	patch includes a variety of fixes from a variety of
	authors, including the insidious planet off-by-one bug,
	wormholes in galaxies 1, 2, 3, and 5, wormhole effects,
	and new SYSDEF options to control wormholes &amp; the
	galaxy metal planet layout. Contributors: Mike, Bill, and
	Rob. </p>

<p>
	August 23 - Bob G releases server patch 15; this patch is
	essentially a port to SGI machines. </p>

<HR>

Things get pretty vague in here..

<p>
	Essentially, from the last entry in 1994 until recently,
	things have changed quite a bit. A major point in this
	time period was the copyright confusion from USU,
	involving Brandon, Kurt, and Larry. At some point, the GNU
	copyleft had been slapped on the code. Kurt and Larry both
	objected to this, and after some discussion involving
	those three and Bob, Kurt &amp; Larry's original copyright
	was restored to the code. </p>

<p>
	During this time as well, the server is brought to 2.4p2
	by Brandon. The client is brought up to 2.3p14 by various
	people and patches. </p>

<p>
	It's rumored that there is a full-color client with shaded
	XPMs floating around, code named <b>TedTurner</b>.
	Presumably development on this is continuing somewhere,
	probably around version 0.8, perhaps? ;) Other rumors
	include difficulties building the client on small memory
	machines due to the enormous size of the static image
	code, as well as the colormap being incorrect on several
	8-bit displays. It is also reported that this client kicks
	the living tar out of every other client on earth when
	working properly, though. </p>

<p>
	And now, for an encore presentation, mid-1995: </p>

<HR>
	May - June 1995 - The server is brought up to patchlevel 6
	by Mike McGrath and Bob Glamm. The most notable
	contributions during this period are the terrain effects
	(asteroids &amp; nebulae) and new balanced PLC-approved
	ship values by Mike McGrath, and the server-side socket
	code (with the GNU compression libs) for the terrain by
	Bob. Client patch 15 is also released; it includes
	client-side socket code for the terrain, also from Bob.
	This patch has no code for displaying asteroids or nebula,
	though.

<p>
	End of June 1995 - Cassius (the primary server for the
	past academic year) is dying; it is to be replaced by two
	servers. Mike McGrath will run dexter.psych.umn.edu (hey,
	Mike, choose a cool name for it), and Ken Germann/Bob
	Glamm will run Skypoint (netrek.skypoint.net). Rob still
	runs Arctica (Wow! Longest running server to date).
	Stephen Franks runs Field of Dreams
	(field-of-dreams.mit.edu). Other Paradise servers in
	Europe and corporate America pop up. The Zoo Crew (led by
	David Putzolu, Cassius' server god) win the Spring '95
	Paradise League. Bob Glamm leaves MSI, moves all ftp and
	web site contents over to ftp.cs.umn.edu; space was
	provided by Professor John Riedl (Computer Science,
	University of Minnesota). </p>

<hr>
October, 1997. 
<br>
	A Long Time Has Passed. With the departure and graduation
	of many of the original coders, and a continued lack of
	volunteers to put up a ParadiseII Netrek server somewhere
	centrally located, Paradise has fallen into the grey area
	of software and idea limbo. We occasionally hear squeaks
	out of some dyed-in-the-wool paradise players of old that
	they're going to set up a Paradise server, but nothing
	ever happens. Due to fewer people using paradise clients
	and a shitty network, <em>deepspace.netrek.org</em> never
	took off, and now the <em>pnetrek.org</em> domain has
	expired. I will hold onto the code for as long as I am
	able.

<hr noshade size=5>

~2000.
<br>
	Some noise can be heard on mailing-lists & servers: some
	people are getting back at it again. Efforts are spent on
	merging the code of the regular client with the TT
	(TedTurner), which from now on should be called just
	"client".
<p>
	Along with the changes on the client, the server is
	undergoing some changes, too. Most noteworthy is the
	attempt to implement T-mode capable robots, so the server
	can run all the time in T-mode to allow everyone at
	everytime to practice the real game, not just ship control
	skills. </p>

<p>
	Some game behaviour will change, too, because it's
	commonly believed that the previous gameplay didn't force
	enough teamplay, allowing for players to play on their own
	without paying attention to the team. </p>

<p>
	Should the changes be successful and give us hope that the
	gameplay will improve so much that people will like to
	play Paradise again after the first look, then a major
	public distribution is planned with the help of known
	Linux/Free-Unix distributors (commercial). </p>
