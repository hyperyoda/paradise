<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

	Do you have a question that you can't find the answer for
	here? Send eMail to the Editor, whose address you can
	find on the starting page, and he will add your question
	and answer to this doc.

<p>
	The worst that can happen is that he'll give you an
	answer, write it down for everyone else's benefit, and
	publicly thank you. What do you have to lose?

<dt><b>Q</b>
	<dd> Is there an easy way to determine a planets/ship's
	location?

<dt><b>A</b>
	<dd> For a ship? Not always.
<p>
	If they used the <tt>F</tt> key to distress then you will
	get a sector number and a planet in their message. The
	first number in the sector is an x coordinate, the second
	is a y coordinate. Sectors are numbered from 1 to 6 in a
	left-to-right or top-to-bottom order. If you have "Draw
	galactic map grid" enabled in your Options window, you
	should be able to locate the person quickly using this
	method. </p>

<p>
	Once you have the grid you should be able to locate their
	ship position indicators (`K3', `Ra'). This assumes they
	aren't under a dogpile. You can still warp to that sector
	and impulse to them. </p>

<p>
	For a planet?  Not trivial, but fairly easy.
</p>

<p>
	Use `P' to bring up the planet list window. Search for the
	name of the planet alphabetically and then look at its
	entry in the sctr column. This is the sector the planet is
	in. Remember that planets on the galactic have the
	`Planet' or `New' prefix removed. </p>

<dt><b>Q</b>
	<dd> Is there an easy way to determine the source of
	armies for your team?

<dt><b>A</b>
	<dd> Yes.
<p>
	Press `B' until you get some planet bitmaps on your
	galactic that look like this:<br>

	<img src="../images/galactic-facilities.gif"><br>

	Anything with a little man on the left has extra armies
	which you can beam up and use to beat up on enemy planets.
	Actually, you can beam one extra army off after the man
	disappears, but that's an advanced tactic.

<dt><b>Q</b>
	<dd> Do the "gurus" remap their keyboards so they can
	phaser and torp easier?

<dt><b>A</b>
	<dd> Yes. Most ``gurus'' do rearrange their keyboards.
	Most of them don't even use the mouse to fire.

<p>
	Here's my (Editor: Brazilian's ?) keymap. I don't
	claim it's the best, but it works for me.

<dt><b>Q</b>
	<dd> How come everybody locks on me and phasers me even
	before I can get my cloaking device turned off?

<dt><b>A</b>
	<dd> They are good, lucky, or both. Hit &lt;TAB&gt; to
	toggle your galactic between normal-sized and zoomed. The
	zoomed view makes it easier to phaser enemies. Remember
	that the cloaked position you see is inaccurate.

<p>
	They could also be using missiles as indicators, since
	they are homing on normal servers. </p>

<p></p>

<dt><b>Q</b>
	<dd> What are some good macros to have?

<dt><b>A</b>
	<dd> Here's a couple of macro I (Editor: again, Brazilian ?) use:

<pre>
macro.f.T: $tapUn %?2=$tapA%{AGRI%!    %}      %2%{near $tasn in $tap@%!is targeT%}
macro.y.T: $thui is going to die
macro.Y.T: $thui is crippled near $tapn, get him if you can.
macro.h.T: Somebody kill $thui near $tapn NOW
</pre>

<p></p>

<dt><b>Q</b>
	<dd> Who are the best players so I can observe them to see
	what they do?

<dt><b>A</b>
	<dd> Rank is a good first guess at who's a good player.
	Anybody who's made Midshipman probably has their act
	together.

<p></p>

<dt><b>Q</b>
	<dd> How do I increase my rank?

<dt><b>A</b>
	<dd> Uh,

<p> Crush, kill, destroy! </p>
<p>
	Seriously, bombing and taking planets are fairly
	important. If you just play hard, you should get enough
	rank to fly bases in a few weeks. Any rank beyond that is
	scumming territory and you'd have to read the <u>rank
	system document</u> (Editor: which hasn't been written
	yet) to figure out what you're missing. </p>

<p></p>

<dt><b>Q</b>
	<dd> Whats a jumpship and utility ship do?

<dt><b>A</b>
	<dd> A jumpship is a big engine with docking ports. It is
	designed for hauling ships around the universe REAL fast.
	A good jumpship pilot can SERIOUSLY augment the taking
	power of a skilled carrier. This power is increased if a
	dedicated escort comes along.

<p>
	A utility ship is a <b>very</b> lightweight base. It can
	carry armies without having to get kills, but can not
	orbit planets. It can refuel ships that are docked to it.
	PTs can enter the game docked to the UT (for a finite
	number of times, then the UT needs to refit). </p>

<p></p>

<dt><b>Q</b>
	<dd> ... fighters as weapons. How do you get em,

<dt><b>A</b>
	<dd> You don't normally. Fighters were an experiment
	started at Eden. We decided they needed a little more work
	than we could currently dedicate to them before they
	became a balanced part of the game.

<p>
	On servers where carriers (CV) are allowed, you can beam
	up armies and deploy 8 fighters for each army (max. 8 at
	once) as a replacement for torps. Those fighters are
	server controled in that they seek out the nearest (to
	mouse or own ship ?) enemy ship and deliver a single torp.
	Those torps are well aimed, but the fighters don't possess
	great maneuveribility. They are most useful on long ranged
	targets.

<br>
	It's hard to defend against fighters, but it's possible:
	either you det a lot (but eventually you die), or you have
	to hit the small fighters with a phaser. Whenever a unit
	of 8 is incomplete, the CV loses an army. </p>
