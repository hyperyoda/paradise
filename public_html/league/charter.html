<h1>Charter of the Paradise League Council</h1>

  Draft revision

<p>

  The Paradise League Council (PLC) is pretty new and hasn't even completed
its first season of games.  If you have any suggestions, complaints or
comments about this document send email to
<tt>users.sf.net@glamm</tt>.

<h1> Purpose </h1>

  The purpose of the PLC is to oversee league play and define standard
paradise.  It serves the players by
<ul>

<li> providing a stable base for paradise servers to build upon.

<li> arbitrating disputes in league play.

</ul>

<h1> Membership </h1>

  The members of the PLC are divided into two sections, voting and
non-voting.

<p>

  The voting membership is composed of ``gods'' from paradise servers
(the core voters) and others appointed by the core voters.  Only one
voting member per organization is necessary to present the views of
that organization.

<p>

 A server god can be either a code hacker or just an administrator but
must represent the dominant view of that organization.

<p>

The non-voting members include all Paradise League team captains and
any interested observers.

<p>

  Server gods are included on the PLC because they will be
implementing the PLC's decisions.  The core voters will appoint
non-god voters whose opinions are respected in the paradise community
and who will present important opinions that would otherwise be
unrepresented.

<p>

  League Captains are included so that they will hear of changes that
affect their games.  It is expected that they will make their opinions
known.  Since the purpose of the PLC is to serve the team captains,
the voting members will listen to the opinions of the captains.

<p>

  Other interested parties may join the PLC and contribute to the
discussion.  However they should understand that the Paradise League
Council's main duty is to Paradise players.

<h1> Responsibilities</h1>

<h2> Standard Source </h2>

  It is the responsibility of the PLC to establish <b>the</b> source
code for paradise, both client and server.

<p>

  Server gods and players come up with ideas for new features, new
rules, or changes to old rules.  They will undoubtedly test these on
various servers.  If a change is popular, it will be proposed for
league play.

<p>

  All changes that can affect game play shall be placed before the PLC
for consideration.  The PLC should not approve a change that has
undergone little playtesting.  Changes that do <b>not</b> affect game play
usually do not need to be cleared by the PLC.

<p>

  It is expected that server gods will make the source code for poorly
tested changes available to other server gods.  This will appear as
patches containing logic that is off by default.  Interested server
gods may playtest these modifications by activating the code.  The PLC
should assist in the dissemination of these modifications unless they
are clearly detrimental to game play.

<p>

  The PLC will maintain an archive site for Paradise standard source
code.  An appointee of the PLC will verify that all submitted patches
to the source code comply with the decisions of the PLC.

<h2> League Games </h2>

  It is the responsibility of the PLC to oversee league games.

<p>

  Before each season the PLC shall announce which version of the
source code shall be used in League games.  Barring major bugs, this
source shall remain unchanged throughout the season.  All league games
for that season shall be played with that source.

<p>

  Before the start of each season the PLC shall establish
<ul>
	<li> a deadline for registration of teams
	<li> a date for the beginning of the season
	<li> a date for the end of the season
</ul>
and announce these to the public.

<p>

  An appointee of the PLC shall accept team rosters from captains and
make them available to the public at least through anonymous ftp.

<p>

No player may be a member of more than one Paradise League team.  If
the publicly available team roster differs from the current team
roster one week before a match, the captain must notify his opponent
of the change in roster, or the new players will be considered
substitutes and subject to veto by the opposing captain (See <a
href="rulebook.html#sect2.2p0">rulebook
Section 2.2</a>).

<p>

  An appointee of the PLC shall assign opponents and make this
information available to the public before the beginning of the
season.  When scheduling the matches, the appointee must consider the
effect of school holidays and other factors which limit the number of
games that can be played in a season.  It is the responsibilty of the
individual team captains to actually set a time and place for the
games.

<p>

  An appointee of the PLC will accept game results from team captains.
This appointee shall post to the appropriate newsgroup (currently
alt.games.netrek.paradise) to publicize the results of the match and
accumulate them in an archive.  At the end of the season the appointee
shall accumulate and publicize the final results and place them in the
same archive.

<p>

  Any matches not completed at the end of the season count as a double
forfeit.  This is considered bad form.

<p>

  It is the responsibility of the PLC to arbitrate any disputes that
may arise in the course of playing league games.  In the event of a
dispute, teams should finish the match and bring the matter up with
the PLC afterwards.
