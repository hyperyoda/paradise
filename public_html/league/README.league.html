<h1>The Paradise League Server</h1>

<h2>How to set up a paradise league server</h2>

  Compile the server.  If you have a working server already, you're
good to go.  There are no special options to turn on to configure a
league tournament server.

<p>

  Instead of invoking listen with "listen -p 2592" start four of them:

<pre>
% listen -H -p 3333
% listen -A -p 4444
% listen -H -O -p 1111
% listen -A -O -p 2222
</pre>

  The listen program automatically invokes ntserv with the proper
arguments and ntserv then invokes the daemon with the correct
arguments.  A daemon running in league mode does NOT use the .sysdef
file.  Any necessary adjustments will be made by the League Council
(you can modify sysdefaults.c or getship.c if you REALLY want to
change something, but we discourage it).

<p>

  People can then connect to the port of their choice and they will be
forced onto the home or the away team.  The listen programs with -O
will force the player to be an <a href="../observe.html">observer</a>
at first.

<h2>How to play a league game</h2>

  Once in the game players have a number of commands available to
them.  To access these commands send yourself a message starting with
the word "league" (or any abbreviation down to "le").

<p>

  Normally one player will be captain and declare himself so by
issuing the command "league captain".  The captain's next duty is to
name his team with "league teamname <i>string</i>".

<p>

  The away team has first choice of empires.  To choose an empire the
captain issues the command "league <i>shortname</i>".  The available
empires are FED, ROM, KLI, and ORI.  The home team then chooses an
empire.

<p>

  Once empires are chosen both captains issue the command "league
start", everyone explodes, and the game enters the warmup.  After 1
minute of warmup everyone explodes again and the game begins
("commence scumming, you twinks!").

<p>

  <a href="../controls.html#league" >Other commands</a> are available under
the league prefix.  Some of them are restricted to captains.
