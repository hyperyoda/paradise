<h2>Game Summary</h2>

  A week ago <a href="THP-vs-FBM-1.html">FBM defeated THP</a> in a 5v5
match.  Enraged by this embarrasing loss, Hammor challenged the Future
Business Majors to a rematch.
  THP, aided by a strategic empire choice, managed to maintain a
scumming lead over FBM through most of the game despite the tactical
shortcomings of the THP players.  The final score was THP 14, FBM 7.

<p>

  At Lynx's suggestion, THP chose Orion.  The orions had two entire
systems within easy scumming reach.  FBM chose Federation, which also
had two systems but in not-so-easy scumming reach.

<p>

  In the initial bombing waves both teams did fairly well.  The Orion
homeworld was bombed flat, but not stoneaged.  Hammor, the base,
suffered from some distractions and floundering but managed to recover
from a fairly brutal ogg with the help of his teammates.  The distance
between the two races also played a role.  The Romulan shipyard was
destroyed by cadence shortly into the game, but Thought drove the WB
into a star in order to get an SB.  FBM recovered the shipyard in
short order.

<p>

  THP started scumming madly. While FBM was stuck at 8 planets, and
plagued occasionally by revolts.  25 minutes into the game, THP had
scummed 15 planets and shortly afterwards both team hit the 25-planet
limit.

<p>

  Since both sides had an ample army supply (at one point THP had two
SY-AGRIs in tactical distance of each other, and later on Hammor had
25 armies on board and 42 on the planet he was guarding) it was then a
contest of who could neutralize enemy planets and take in their own
empires.  THP was more successful, at one point holding 19 of the 25
planets.  Despite some last-minute destruction of THP planets, FBM was
unable to tip the balance in their favor.

<p>

  FBM usually had more potential carriers in the air.  THP seemed to
have great difficulty hunting them down.  At one point Hammor got
pissed off enough to refit into a BB and ogged bpence who was all
alone in the THP backfield.  This was the source of Hammor's sole def
and epk.  A glance at the kill ratios of both teams will give you an
idea of the problem.  Whether this was a lack of dogfighting skill or
poor choice of battles, the archivist couldn't tell (he was busy
screaming his head off).

<p>

  Ninja, who was lagged to death, spent most of his time scouting
(providing his team with a great advantage) and never won a dogfight.

<h2>Post-Game Interview with the Captains</h2>

<dl>

<dt> <i>Archivist:</i> <dd> So, Hammor, you won the rematch.  Do you
feel vindicated?

<dt> <i>Hammor:</i> <dd> Yeah, but we didn't genocide them.  I'm kinda
dissapointed in the overall course of the game.

<dt> <i>Archivist:</i> <dd> How so?  You were in the lead almost the
entire game.

<dt> <i>Hammor:</i> <dd> Yeah, but we had a terrain advantage.  I
think that we should have been able to advance upon the enemy instead
of trading for our backfield.  I wasn't willing to risk losing to
engage them in a more intense game.

</dl>

(The archivist hasn't had a chance to interview Thought yet, so he
made this interview up for the interem).

<dl>

<dt> <i>Archivist:</i> <dd> So, Thought, how do you feel about losing
the rematch?

<dt> <i>Thought:</i> <dd> I'm not particularly pleased, but it's not
THAT embarrassing.  We were down a man for most of the match.

<dt> <i>Archivist:</i> <dd> What do you think the major factor in your
loss was?

<dt> <i>Thought:</i> <dd> I'd say it was the distance factor.  They
outscummed us at the start and we just couldn't project enough power
to counterscum effectively.  <p> I am rather pleased with my team's
ability to get and keep kills.  THP was rather lame at ogging.
