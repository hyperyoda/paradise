<h2>Game Summary</h2>

  The previous Wednesday, THP had invaded pippin and crushed the world
in two successive pickup games.  Both games lasted about 45 minutes
and ended in genocides.

<p>

At the suggestion of one of the enemy players, THP agreed to host a
league-style match the next Wednesday.

<p>

  It was a disaster.  Rob had finished a rework of the control_mess.o
module and hadn't really had a chance to test it out.  It also seems
that patch 5 introduced a bug where missiles and plasmas wouldn't
track.  The enemy team was not familiar with league play at all.
Probably half of them hadn't even read the documentation that had been
advertised with the match.  Add to this that THP had only 4 players at
the start of T, while the enemy team had 8 on the field and 2 on the
bench.

<p>

Only some deft editing of the shared memory allowed the game to start.
THP had Fed, the world had Rom.

<p>

  Since missiles wouldn't track, Hammor as base had a lot of
difficulty defending himself from oggs.  That, and a shortage of
teammates led to his speedy demise.  Minitaur, the Romulan starbase,
survived basically unchallenged until the latter half of the game.

<p>

  THP, with no starbase and no shipyard, resorted to 4th army
skimming.  KL - 1 was unstoppable and the Roms had difficulty keeping
kills.  While the Roms had quickly scummed their way to 10 planets in
the beginning, THP enjoyed a slow, steady rise in the size of their
empire.

<p>

  Perhaps due to technical difficulties, perhaps due to disgust, some
Roms bailed.  Also, the Away captain had been kicked onto the bench
and his client flaked out, preventing him from talking to his team.
Add in the late arrival of a few more THP warriors and the tide
turned.  At 30 minutes the Roms began to see a spastic erosion of
their empire.  Reduced to 5 planets at 40 minutes, and with teams now
even in number, their fate was sealed.

<p>

  THP didn't manage a geno, but did give their opponents a tense LPS.
Final score was 17-1, THP victorious.
