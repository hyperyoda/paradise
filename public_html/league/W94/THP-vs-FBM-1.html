<h2>Game Summary</h2>

  In a disgusting scum-from-behind win, Future Business Majors
defeated The Hammor Party.  In a post-game interview Hammor was heard
to say "We was robbed!".

<p>

  THP was expecting 10-14 players to show.  They had 8 when the game
got underway.  FBM was also plagued by no-shows, only able to field a
team of 5.  Hammor made his first strategic mistake when he agreed to
play a 5vs5 game.  The 3 extra THP players rotated in and out of the
bench or simply observed.

<p>

  FBM chose ROMs, who had a good planet layout including an extra AGRI
near the homeworld.  It also turned out that an independent planet in
tactical range of the homeworld was a DM, providing a backup shipyard.
THP chose FED, primarily because it had an entire system behind it,
giving THP a fairly safe place to scum planets

<p>

  Partway through the game Toonatic showed up for FBM.  Hammor, having
access to the shared memory, edited the maxplayers to 6 so that
Toonatic and a corresponding THP player could join in.  Toonatic was
flying a 2.01p9 client and, since this client is older than dirt, he
was unable to enter the game.  THP played with an extra player until
somebody got Hammor's attention and he edited it back down.

<p>

  During most of the game FBM wavered between 7 and 10 planets while
THP bobbled between 11 and 12.  Hammor was the primary planet scum for
THP while FBM had Raynfala, Thought, and bpence all scumming.

<p>

  In the last 10 minutes of the game, Hammor made his second mistake.
Rather than concentrate on taking planets and ogging enemy carriers,
he called a base ogg.  While Hammor scummed, the three free players of
THP ogged the stuffing out of the base, finally making Karrde go *POP*
for the second time in the game.  However, while THP was ogging,
Tought and bpence managed to take 6 planets, 4 of them from THP.
This, coupled with two revolts, sounded the death knell for THP.
Final score was FBM:14, THP:11.

<P>

  The lesson is, 5 players aren't enough to fight over 25 planets.

<h2>Post-Game Interview with the Captains</h2>

<dl>

<dt> <i>Archivist:</i> <dd> So, Hammor, looks like you got your ass kicked.

<dt> <i>Hammor:</i> <dd> Fuck you. We was robbed.

<dt> <i>Archivist:</i> <dd> What do you think was your major error?

<dt> <i>Hammor:</i> <dd> I gave him an even break.

<dt> <i>Archivist:</i> <dd> Do you have any plans for a rematch?

<dt> <i>Hammor:</i> <dd> Damn straight!  If he can get his sorry team
together, I'll rematch him, and this time, no 5-player wuss-out.  No
more Mr Nice Guy.

<dt> <i>Archivist:</i> <dd> Any words of consolation to your team?

<dt> <i>Hammor:</i> <dd> Yeah, I'd like to thank everyone who showed up.
Thanks to Bolo for being a textbook faithful base and guarding armies
amazingly well.  Thanks to cadence for bombing a buttload of armies
and resources at the cost of 56 ships.  Thanks to everyone else for
scumming like mad and following my orders even when I was clearly
fucking insane.  I won't let you down next time.

</dl>

(The archivist hasn't had a chance to interview Thought yet, so he
made this interview up for the interem).

<dl>

<dt> <i>Archivist:</i> <dd> So, Thought, how do you feel about winning the
second game in Paradise League history?

<dt> <i>Thought:</i> <dd> Pretty good, Arch.  I'd like to thank Karrde for
doing a good job of protecting the shipyards under withering enemy
fire.  I'd like to thank Raynfala for giving Hammor a hard time
scumming.  I'd like to congratulate everyone else on the
well-distributed planet scumming.

<dt> <i>Archivist:</i> <dd> What would you have done if Hammor hadn't let you
play 5v5 and insisted on a 5v8 game?

<dt> <i>Thought:</i> <dd> Kicked his sorry ass anyway.  He couldn't ogg the
broad side of a barn.  If he wants a rematch, he knows my email
address.  And, by the way, this time we play on MY turf >:)
