  Draft revision

<p><a name="sect0p1"></a>

  The Paradise League Council (PLC) is pretty new and hasn't even
completed its first season of games.  If you have any suggestions,
complaints or comments about this document send email to
<tt>users.sf.net@glamm</tt>.

  I really need to look at the INL rulebook.


<h1>Registering a Team</h1><a name="sect1p0"></a>

  I'm going to adapt some words from Tom Holub he used to announce the
Spring 1994 INL season (the normaltrek equivalent of the Paradise
League):

<blockquote>

``The PL is a collection of teams made up of players from around
the world who are interested in playing organized games of Netrek.  A
team consists of 8 or more players, one of whom will act as the team
captain; there is no limit to the number of players on a team, but no
one may be listed on more than one roster.

<p>

<b>Potential Team Members Read This</b>
<br>
``Your team will be counting on you to show up for all your games. If
your team has fewer than 8 players for a game, they may be forced to
play shorthanded or forfeit the game.  The league is supposed to be
fun, first and foremost, but many people take it quite seriously, and
will be quite angry with you if you fail your team.

<p>

<b>Potential Team Captains Read This</b>
<br>
``The job of team captain takes a lot of time; if you are pressed for
time now, we suggest that you don't volunteer to be a captain.  There
is much secretarial work involved in captaining a team, especially an
at-large team; if you hate secretarial work, don't become a captain.
The other team captains will be counting on you to schedule all your
games, so this is not a position to accept lightly.  If you just want
to play some high-quality games, you are welcome to put a team
together to scrimmage PL teams; the PL, however, is reserved for teams
who plan to be dedicated to the game and who will complete their
schedule (no, we don't know exactly how the scheduling is going to
work).  Please consider this when applying for membership in the PL.

<p>

``It's a good idea to have more than 8 people on your roster; most PL
players are college students with college students' schedules, so it
can be difficult to muster a full team.  Also, in each of the past two
seasons a number of teams have dropped out of the league; this
inconveniences the PL Council and all the teams you were scheduled to
play.  Don't apply if you don't plan to finish the season.''</i>

</blockquote>

  Basically, we take our fun seriously.  If you don't, stick to
pickup and everyone will stay happy.

<p>

<h2> If you wish to be a player, </h2> brag about your talents on
alt.games.netrek.paradise.  In the future the PLC will maintain a WWW
site where you can post your C.V. and captains can browse that board
to find potential teammates.

<p>

<h2> If you wish to be a captain, </h2> collect a group of players.
You will be expected to field at least 8 players for each game and the
council would like to see 12v12 games.  Get players who are very
flexible about game times and won't blow you off (people with real
jobs will serve if they can make evening and weekend games).  Nobody
likes to show up for a game and find they have no opponents.

  Draw yourself a logo.  It should be an X bitmap with dimensions
99x99 (see the manual page for the MIT X11 program ``bitmap'' for an
OK bitmap editor).  The bottom left corner should be left empty so
that the player count can be displayed.  The team name customarily
goes along the top and a logo goes in the bottom right corner.  This
logo will be used in the team selection window during league play.

  Contact the PLC by sending mail to <tt>reed.edu@plc</tt> and send
them your team roster and team logo.  They'll give you a set of
matches to play and then you're on your own!

<h1>The Rules</h1><a name="sect2p0"></a>

<h2>Scheduling a match</h2><a name="sect2.1p0"></a>

  Both captains must agree on the time and place for a match.  It is
in both captains best interests to specify the time zone.  If a time
zone is omitted, the PLC will assume GMT when settling disputes.

<h2>Assembly</h2>

<ul>

  <li> At the time specified for the match, both captains must be
present to begin the pre-game setup.

  <li> If, 15 minutes after the specified time, one side is not ready
to start the opposing captain has the option to declare the unready
team forfeit.

  <li> At any time before the match either captain may forfeit the match.

  <li> At any time before the match, both captains may agree to
declare the game ``fizzled'' and reschedule.

  <li> If the opposing captain agrees, a captain may recruit
substitute players.  These substitutes may not be members of another
PL team.

  <li> On public PL servers captains must respect reservations by
other teams.  If a game cuts into a reservation by another team, the
game must be halted and the server ceded to the teams with the
reservation.

</ul>

<h2>Configuration</h2><a name="sect2.3p0"></a>

<ul>

<li> League games for the Winter '94 season must be played with 60
minutes regulation time and 0 minutes overtime (overtime is not yet
implemented).

  <li> The default maximum players per team (mp/t) is 8.  If both
captains agree this may be increased or decreased.  The PLC encourages
increasing it if teams have enough players and the server can handle
the load.

</ul>

<h2>Play</h2><a name="sect2.4p0"></a>

  Go kick ass.  Despite possible problems try to continue the game
unless things have been irrevocably screwed.  You might win despite
technical difficulties.

<p><a name="sect2.4p1"></a>

  The game should proceed smoothly if the coders have done their job.
Anything that the code lets you do is ``legal''.  If you think any of
these ``laws'' are wrong, try to keep playing, but tell the PLC.  The
coders may have made a mistake interpreting the PLC's intentions.
Game bugs like this should be sorted out as soon as possible.  Game
bugs of this sort may be a basis for annulling the match.

<p><a name="sect2.4p2"></a>

  If you encounter network problems, try to keep playing.  If things
get too bad reschedule the match.

<p><a name="sect2.4p3"></a>

  The team with the most planets at the end wins.

<h2>Bragging</h2><a name="sect2.5p0"></a>

  When the game is over, someone should get the tournament log file
and send it to the PLC's record keeper.  He will parse the tournament
results and publicize the results of the match.

<h1>Problems</h1><a name="sect3p0"></a>

  The Paradise League Council exists to supervise league play.  If
captains have any disputes that they can't resolve on their own, they
should bring it before the PLC.

<p><a name="sect3p1"></a>

  The decisions of the PLC are final.
