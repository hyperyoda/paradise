Paradise Netrek Development</H3>

	What's this? You're whining about some aspect of the game.
	I know, you're thinking "I could reduce the amount of
	communication between client and server to twenty bytes
	per second," or, "Hey, this new monster phaser bolt weapon
	I've been thinking about would be cool to implement."
	Well, here's your chance. Both the server and client
	sources are freely available. In fact, the few libraries
	that they depend on generally come with the system you're
	working on, can be installed easily, or are available from
	the GNU mirrors around the world.

<H3>
<A NAME="SOURCES"></A>Stable Client and Server Sources/Libraries</H3>

	The current server and client sources are available as
	shown below. Libraries that may be required are also shown
	below. Note that whatever the current server, client, or
	library versions are, the links below will always point to
	the latest <B>stable</B> release. Everything else you find
	in the directory is either a previous version or a BETA
	(work in progress), which you should use only if you know
	what you do.

	<br> The items under RSA are not required unless you are
	compiling an authorized binary or if you are building a
	server that does RSA authentication (currently no Paradise
	servers have this implemented, although the code is there
	to do it). Unless you are one of the primary client
	developers , you aren't building an authorizing binary and
	don't need RSA. Besides, unless you have the
	<TT>crypt(1)</TT> key, you won't be able to get at the RSA
	code anyway.

	<P>One final word about RSA: Since RSA is cryptography
	software, it is subject to United States military export
	regulations on cryptography and other national security
	issues. This means that RSA software cannot be exported
	outside the U.S. or Canada. So, unless you are a United
	States or Canadian citizen, <B>and</B> living within the
	United States or Canada, don't ask me for the
	<TT>crypt(1)</TT> key. You won't get it. </p>

<big><b>We need more active developers</b></big>
<p>
	We need a next generation of players and coders to pick up
	the code and maintain a noteworthy offspring of a
	noteworthy classic game.

	<br>

	Get the code, check it out, get your friends to play it
	with you, and improve where necessary. Get in contact with
	the project admins to inform them about your interest to
	join the dev-crew. Join the mailing-lists and ask! </p>

	<p> Discussion about Paradise Netrek development, game
	play, and league play occurs on these mailing lists,
	forums and hopefully soon on the newsgroup again, too.</p>

	<p>Except for the newsgroup everything else is hosted by
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge.net</a>.

	<p> The USENET newsgroup for discussion regarding Netrek
	in general. Once there was a special Paradise NG, but
	since the fall of Paradise several years ago it's only
	polluted by SPAM. Therefore, if you want to use the
	USENET, try it in the general Netrek group. You could very
	well meet long-ago fellow Paradisers there. Not moderated.

<H3>
<A NAME="WORKERS"></A>Specific Paradise Workers</H3>

	<p>
	Here's a list of (formerly) active Paradise Workers and what they're
	up to currently. It's alphabetical because I like it that
	way. Note that with the apparent demise of most Paradise
	activity, most of these people have moved on to other
	things, so if you poke them and your email bounces, don't
	blame me. (Editor: if somebody knows of up to date
	informations, either correct eMail-adresseses or if they
	want to be removed from this list, let me know) </p>

	<p>
	The addresses are reversed to keep away robot-grabber spammers.
