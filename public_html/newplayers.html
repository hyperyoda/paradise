	So you've made the choice to play Paradise Netrek!
	Congratulations, and welcome!
<ol>
<li> <h3>First Steps</H3>

<oL>
<li>
<dl>
<DT>
	<em>Do you have a TCP/IP connection?</em></DT>
<DD>
	Chances are that if you're reading this document, the
	answer is yes. Since the protocol to read Web pages
	requires a TCP/IP link to the Internet, you probably have
	TCP/IP. Paradise is TCP/IP based, so if you don't have a
	TCP/IP link, you can't play. TCP/IP is just a fancy way of
	saying that you're on the Internet, for you net
	newbies.</DD>
</dl>

<li>
<dl>
<DT>
	<em>Do you have X11 installed on your machine?</em></DT>

<DD>
	If you're using a Web browser like Netscape, you probably
	have X11. As far as I know, most UNIX-based workstations
	with graphics capability use X11. Simply put, X11 is a
	graphics system found on many workstations. Windows or
	Windows NT or a Mac is *NOT* X11. You need X11 to play
	Paradise, due to it's graphical nature. (maybe changed
	soon)</DD>
</dl>

<li>
<dl>
<DT>
	<em>Do you have a supported architecture?</em> (currently not all listed here are supported)</DT>

<DD>
	This one is a tough question, especially if you are new to
	computers or don't have access to the physical machine
	itself. Take a look at this list and decide if you have a
	machine and an operating system that matches one of these
	combinations:</DD>

(*) -- The client is currently NOT under development.
<br>
	First the general client changes have to be done, then we
	can try to port. If you want to support something not
	mentioned here, get the source, succeed in building a
	running client and announce on the paradise-workers
	mailing-list, how the source must be modified to succeed
	as you did.

</dl>
</ol>

<ol>
<p>
Examples:</p>

<li>
	Joe Trekker has an Alpha running OSF/1 sitting on his
	desk. He checks the machine type list, and finds 'Alpha'
	in the list. He scans over to the right of the word
	'Alpha', and finds 'OSF/1'. Both match, so he can play.

<li>
	Gnarl E. Dude has a Pentium-based PC sitting on his desk.
	He scans down the machine type list and finds 'intel-based
	PC' in the list. Now, Gnarl knows that he is running Linux
	He scans the OS list to the right of PC and finds 'Linux';
	he's ecstatic. There is a binary for him to use.

<li>
	Imnotta Realuser has a 386sx-based PC sitting on his desk
	that runs Windows 3.1. He finds 'intel-based PC' in the
	machine type list and thinks "Great! There's hope yet!".
	But, after looking at the OS column and finding that
	Windows isn't supported yet, he's crestfallen. There's no
	binary for Windows! Poor guy can't play.

<li>
	Mac User has a Macintosh Plus sitting on his desk. He
	looks at the machine type list in a pitiful attempt to
	find Macintosh listed there, but to no avail. 68k
	Macintoshes aren't supported, so he can't play. He'll just
	have to get a Power Mac and run MkLinux.

</ol>
<p>
If you've answered YES! to all 3 questions, then you can play! See the
next section for how to obtain a trek program (called a 'client' or a 'binary'
from here on in this document).
</p>


<li>
<A NAME="GETCLIENT"></A><H3>Client Naming Conventions</H3>
<p>
	You've answered YES! to the above three questions! Great!
	You can get a client and play! But the next question, of
	course, is how on earth do you get a client? </p>

<P>
	First, you've got to know a little bit about the naming
	conventions us Paradise hackers use. It's a little
	convoluted, but it helps us keep track of what stage we're
	at while we're coding it. </p>

<P>
The naming convention for binaries follows this form:
<BR>
<strong>&lt;type-version-machine-OS[.dynamic]&gt;</strong>
</p>

<P>
	Now, the <strong>&lt;type&gt;</strong> is either
	<big>tedturner</big> or <big>paradise</big> (dying out
	since everything has grown into <big>tedturner</big>).
<br>
	However, the other things you'll need to worry about:
</p>

<p>
	<strong>&lt;machine-OS&gt;</strong>: Since we have (had ;)
	so many binaries for so many different machines, naming
	the clients with the machine or OS name in them is a
	logical solution to an otherwise difficult naming problem.
	Here is a table of translations: </p>

<table align=center border=1>
<tr>
<th>Machine,OS</th><th>Name</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan=3>PC, Linux </td><td>intel-Linux-X11R5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>intel-Linux-X11R6, a.out or ELF</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>intel-Linux-term</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PC, FreeBSD </td><td>intel-FreeBSD</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PC, Unixware </td><td>intel-Unixware</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PC, Solaris </td><td>intel-Solaris</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan=2>SGI, IRIX </td><td>SGI-IRIX4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>SGI-IRIX5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>RS/6000, AIX </td><td>RS6000-AIX</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sun, SunOS 4 </td><td>Sparc-SunOS</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sun, Solaris 2 </td><td>Sparc-Solaris</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>
	<em>[.dynamic]</em>: For some operating systems
	that undergo many revisions, we post two versions of the
	client: a static and a dynamic version. Static versions of
	the client have the required libraries linked right into
	them and are usually bigger. Dynamic versions of the
	client don't have the required libraries linked into them
	and are usually smaller, but require that you have at
	least the library version of the developer. If you don't,
	a typical error message is 'Shared library &lt;blah blah
	blah&gt; is older than expected', but the client could
	still possibly run. </p>

<P>
	If you don't want to worry about all of this semi-arcane
	stuff, pick out the static client; it will work on every
	system, no matter what the library version is. The dynamic
	client will save you some disk space, but as of this
	writing, clients are typically less than 3MB in size. </p>

<P>
	Current systems that have two sets of binaries are Linux,
	FreeBSD, SunOS 4, and Solaris 2. </p>

<li>
<H3>Getting a Client</H3>
<p>
Alright, you've survived the THREE QUESTIONS and you've learned about the
huge naming convention those wild'n'crazy Paradise hackers have created
for you. Now you can get a client?
</p>

<P>Clicking on the following URL will let you use your Web browser to fetch
a client:
<BR><A
HREF="http://www.netrek.org/pub/paradise/">http://www.netrek.org/pub/paradise/</A>
</p>
<P>Or, you can use anonymous ftp. Here is an example anonymous ftp session
(assuming you want to get the ELF Linux client). Examples of what you would
type are emphasized:

<PRE>$ <b>ftp ftp.netrek.org</b>

<H3><A NAME="PROBLEMS"></A>Possible Problems / Q and A</H3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
	Q. When I type netrek, it tells me Command not found even
	when I'm in the directory it is in. What's wrong?
<BR>A.
	It's probably not been made executable. At the command
	line type <PRE>chmod 755 netrek</PRE> (netrek is the name
	of the client binary). This should make it executable.
	Also, some sites don't put . into the path. In this case,
	type <PRE>./netrek</PRE> on the command line (again,
	netrek is the name of the client binary) to execute it.
	</p>

<li>
<P>
	Q. I got a binary, but it says something about lib*.so:
	expected version x, found version y?
<BR>A. You need a
	static binary. Get the -static client. See the explanation
	on the difference between
<A HREF="#GETCLIENT">static and dynamic</A> binaries. </p>

<li>
<P>
	Q. The client says 'Can't connect to metaserver.' What's
	wrong?
<BR>A. Either the metaserver is down, or your
	machine isn't doing name lookups right, or your machine
	isn't connected to the Internet, or you're behind a
	firewall that restricts outgoing packets. If the
	metaserver is down or your machine isn't doing name
	lookups right, there's still hope. If not, you're out of
	luck. </p>

	<P>If there's still hope, try this command:
<PRE>$ <A HREF="telnet://metaserver.us.netrek.org:3521">telnet metaserver.us.netrek.org 3521</A> | grep 'P$'</PRE>
<br>
	This command should list all Paradise servers. If it
	doesn't, the metaserver is down. In this case, you'll have
	to use the -h option to netrek to specify a host; e.g.
	<PRE>$ netrek.paradise -h paradise-lost.kulua.org</PRE>
	will connect you to paradise-lost. </p>

<li>
<p>
	Q. I can play for awhile, but then the client unexpectedly
	quits. Why?
<BR>A. Well, barring a server or a client bug,
	odds are you failed the cluecheck. To get a clue, see the
	section on reading messages and the cluecheck in the
<A HREF="primer.html">Primer</A>. </p>

<li>
<p>
	Q. There are soooo few Paradise players logged in, how can
	I find some to play with ?

<br>
	A. Either you wait a long time until somebody else joins
	you (bad, can take very long), or you join the

<a href="develop.html#NEWSLISTS"><b>Paradise games mailing-list</b></a>
	and request a game to happen--best with time and place
	at which you like it to happen. </p>

</ul>

<P>
	If you have a question that you want answered, send your
	question to Rado <I>(users.sourceforge.net@rado)</I>.
	He'll answer your question and put it on the
<A HREF="info/FAQ.html">Frequently Asked Questions</A> web
	page. </p>
